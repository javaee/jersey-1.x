    <title>XML Support</title>

    <para>As you probably already know, Jersey uses MessageBodyWriters and MessageBodyReaders to parse
        incoming request and create outgoing responses. Every user can create its own representation but...
        this is not recommended way how to do things. XML is proven standard for interchanging information,
        especially in web services. Jerseys supports low level data types used for direct manipulation and
        JAXB XML entities.</para>

    <section>
        <title id="xml.lowlevel">Low level XML support</title>

        <para>Jersey currently support several low level data types: <code>StreamSource</code>, <code>SAXSource</code>,
            <code>DOMSource</code> and <code>Document</code>. You can use these types as return type or method (resource)
            parameter. Lets say we want to test this feature and we have helloworld sample as starting point. All we
            need to do is add methods (resources) which consumes and produces XML and types mentioned above will
            be used.</para>

        <example>
            <title>Low level XML test - methods added to HelloWorldResource.java</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">    @Path("1")
    @POST
    public StreamSource get1(StreamSource streamSource) {
        return streamSource;
    }

    @Path("2")
    @POST
    public SAXSource get2(SAXSource saxSource) {
        return saxSource;
    }

    @Path("3")
    @POST
    public DOMSource get3(DOMSource domSource) {
        return domSource;
    }

    @Path("4")
    @POST
    public Document get4(Document document) {
        return document;
    }</programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>Both MessageBodyReaders and MessageBodyWriters are used in this case, all we need is do POST request
            with some XML document as a request entity. I want to keep this as simple as possible so I'm going to
            send only root element with no content: <code>"&lt;test /&gt;"</code>. You can create Jersey client to
            do that or use some other tool, for example <code>curl</code> as I did. (<code>curl -v http://localhost:9998/helloworld/1 -d "&lt;test /&gt;"</code>).
            You should get exactly same XML from our service as is present in the request; in this case, XML headers
            are added to response but content stays. Feel free to iterate through all resources.</para>

        <title id="xml.jaxb.xmlRootElement">Getting started with JAXB</title>

        <para>Good start for people which already have some experience with JAXB annotations is JAXB sample.
            You can see various usecases there. This text is mainly meant for those who don't have prior experience
            with JAXB. Don't expect that all possible annotations and their combinations
            will be covered in this chapter, <ulink url="http://jaxb.dev.java.net">JAXB (JSR 222 implementation)</ulink> is pretty complex and comprehensive. But if
            you just want to know how you can interchange XML messages with your REST service, you are looking
            at right chapter.</para>

        <para>Lets start with simple example. Lets say we have class <code>Planet</code> and service
        which produces "Planets"</para>

        <example>
            <title>Planet class</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@XmlRootElement
public class Planet {
    public int id;
    public String name;
    public double radius;
}
            </programlisting>
        </example>

        <example>
            <title>Resource class</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@Path("planet")
public class Resource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
    public Planet getPlanet() {
        Planet p = new Planet();
        p.id = 1;
        p.name = "Earth";
        p.radius = 1.0;

        return p;
    }
}            </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>You can see there is some extra annotation declared on <code>Planet</code> class.
        Concretely <code>XmlRootelement</code>. What it does? This is a JAXB annotation which
        maps java class to XML element. We don't need specify anything else, because <code>Planet</code>
        is very simple class and all fields are public. In this case, XML element name will be derived
        from class name or you can set name property: <code>@XmlRootElement(name="yourName")</code>.</para>

        <para>Our resource class will respond to GET /planet with
            <programlisting language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;
                &lt;planet&gt;
                        &lt;id&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
                        &lt;name&gt;Earth&lt;/name&gt;
                        &lt;radius&gt;1.0&lt;/radius&gt;
                &lt;/planet&gt;
            </programlisting>

            which might be exactly what we want... or not. Or we might not really care, because we
            can use Jersey client for making requests to this resource and this is easy as:
            <code>Planet planet = webResource.path("planet").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_TYPE).get(Planet.class);</code>.
            There is pre-created WebResource object which points to our applications context root and
            we simpli add path (in our clase its "planet"), accept header (not mandatory, but service could
            provide different content based on this header; for example text/html can be served for web browsers) and
            at the end we specify that we are expecting <code>Planet</code> class via GET request.</para>

            <para>There may be need for not just producing XML, we might want to consume it as well.

                <example>
                    <title>Method for consuming Planet</title>
                    <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
    public void setPlanet(Planet p) {
        System.out.println("setPlanet " + p);
    }
                    </programlisting>
                </example>

           After valid request is made (with Jersey client you can do <code>webResource.path("planet").post(p);</code>),
           service will print out string representation of Planet, which can look like <literal>Planet{id=2, name='Mars', radius=1.51}</literal>.
           </para>

        <para>If there is a need for some other (non default) XML representation, other JAXB annotations would
        need to be used. This process is usually simplified by generating java source from XML Schema which is
        done by xjc. Xjc is XML to java compiler and is part of JAXB. See <ulink url="http://jaxb.dev.java.net">JAXB home page</ulink>
        for further details.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title id="xml.jabx.JAXBElement">POJOs</title>

        <para>Sometimes you can't / don't want to add JAXB annotations to source code and you still want
        to have resources consuming and producing XML representation of your classes. In this case, <code>JAXBElement</code>
        class should help you. Let's redo planet resource but this time we won't have <code>XmlRootElement</code>
        annotation on <code>Planet</code> class.</para>

        <example>
            <title>Resource class - JAXBElement</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@Path("planet")
public class Resource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
    public JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt; getPlanet() {
        Planet p = new Planet();
        p.id = 1;
        p.name = "Earth";
        p.radius = 1.0;

        return new JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt;(new QName("planet"), Planet.class, p);
    }

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
    public void setPlanet(JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt; p) {
        System.out.println("setPlanet " + p.getValue());
    }
}            </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>As you can see, everything is little more complicated with JAXBElement. This is because now you need
        to explicitly set element name for <code>Planet</code> class XML representation. Client side is even more ugly
        than server side because you can't do <code>JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt;.class</code> so Jersey client
        API provides way how to workaround it by declaring subclass of <code>GenericType</code>.</para>

        <example>
            <title>Client side - JAXBElement</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">        // GET
        GenericType&lt;JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt;&gt; planetType = new GenericType&lt;JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt;&gt;() {};

        Planet planet = (Planet) webResource.path("planet").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML_TYPE).get(planetType).getValue();
        System.out.println("### " + planet);

        // POST
        Planet p = new Planet();
        // ...

        webResource.path("planet").post(new JAXBElement&lt;Planet&gt;(new QName("planet"), Planet.class, p));           </programlisting>
        </example>

    </section>

    <section>
        <title id="xml.jaxb.JAXBContext">Using custom JAXBContext</title>

        <para>In some scenarios you can take advantage of using custom <code>JAXBContext</code>. Creating
            <code>JAXBContext</code> is expensive operation and if you already have one created, same instance
        can be used by Jersey. Other possible usecase for this is when you need to set some specific things
        to JAXBContext, for example set different classloader.</para>

        <example>
            <title>PlanetJAXBContextProvider</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">@Provider
public class PlanetJAXBContextProvider implements ContextResolver&lt;JAXBContext&gt; {
    private JAXBContext context = null;

    public JAXBContext getContext(Class&lt;?&gt; type) {
        if(type != Planet.class)
            return null; // we don't support nothing else than Planet

        if(context == null) {
            try {
                context = JAXBContext.newInstance(Planet.class);
            } catch (JAXBException e) {
                // log warning/error; null will be returned which indicates that this
                // provider won't/can't be used.
            }
        }
        return context;
    }
}
        </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>Sample above shows simple <code>JAXBContext</code> creation, all you need to do is put
        this <code>@Provider</code> annotated class somewhere where Jersey can find it. Users sometimes
        have problems with using provider classes on client side, so just for reminder - you have to
        declare them in client config (cliend does not anything like package scanning done by server).</para>

        <example>
            <title>Using Provider with Jersey client</title>
            <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">                ClientConfig cc = new DefaultClientConfig();
                cc.getClasses().add(PlanetJAXBContextProvider.class);
                Client c = Client.create(cc);
            </programlisting>
        </example>
