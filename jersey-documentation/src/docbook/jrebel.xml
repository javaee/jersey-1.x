    <title>JRebel support</title>

    <para>Jersey provides basic support for JRebel. JRebel can be used to reload java
        classes at runtime without requiring to redeploy an application. This
        can improve developer productivity.
        Java source can be modified, recompiled, and JRebel will ensure changes
        will be reflected at runtime.</para>

    <para>JRebel isn't opensource and is not for free BUT Zeroturnaround (JRebel's author)
        provides a free license for open source project developers. More details can be found
        on the project website: <ulink url="http://www.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/">http://zeroturnaround.com/jrebel</ulink>.
        Jersey currently supports JRebel version 3.1.2.</para>

        <title id="jrebel.use">How to use JRebel with Jersey</title>

        <para>The jersey-jrebel dependency is required in the pom file:</para>

            <programlisting language="xml">        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.jersey&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;jersey-jrebel&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;&version;&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>The javarebel-maven-plugin plugin can be added to the pom to automatically configure
        JRebel for the case when java is executed from maven:</para>

            <programlisting language="xml">            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.zeroturnaround&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;javarebel-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;

                &lt;executions&gt;
                    &lt;execution&gt;
                        &lt;id&gt;generate-rebel-xml&lt;/id&gt;
                        &lt;phase&gt;process-resources&lt;/phase&gt;
                        &lt;goals&gt;
                            &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;
                        &lt;/goals&gt;
                    &lt;/execution&gt;
                &lt;/executions&gt;

        <title id="jrebel.sample">Using JRebel with the hello world sample</title>

        <para>The following assumes that JRebel has been set up correctly (a JRebel informational message will
            be output if JRebel is enabled).</para>

        <para>
            Download the <ulink
      url="http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/jersey/samples/helloworld/&version;/helloworld-&version;-project.zip">hello world sample</ulink>
      and modify the pom file in accordance with the prevous chapter.</para>

        <para>
            Compile Helloworld sample with <code>mvn clean install</code> and run it with <code>mvn exec:java</code>.
            The Helloworld application is deployed on Grizzly container.</para>

        <para>Use a browser and goto the following URL <ulink uri="http://localhost:9998/helloworld">http://localhost:9998/helloworld</ulink>.
            Messages should be output indicating initialization of Jersey framework, and the browser should
            display <code>Hello World</code>.</para>

        <para>Modify the <code>HelloWorldResource.java</code> file such that the resource method <code>getClichedMessage</code>
            returns a different String value. Run <code>mvn compile</code>. Reload the browser window and
            the browser should display the modified message.</para>

    <section>
        <title id="jrebel.limitations">Limitations</title>
        <para>JRebel currently doesn't notify it's plugin about newly created classes
        that have no reference to existing classes, such as newly created resource or provder classes.
        However, its possible to detect a newly created resource class and use it in your
        application when you are doing some other changes to existing code.
        Why? After a change has beed made, Jersey re-initializes itself and the
        new class can be detected in the process. For this case you you have to
        use class or package scanning for detecting such resource classes.</para>
