release 1.10
- *Breaking change*
  Ant task for generating WADL moved from jersey-server to a newly created contribs/ant-wadl-task module
- *Breaking change*
  Servlet, EJB and CDI integration separated out from the jersey-server module
  When using Jersey in a Servlet container, jersey-server dependency need to be replaced with jersey-servlet

release 1.9.1
- Fixed issue 765
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-765
  Jersey can now marshall/unmarshall all the standard collection types (Set, Queue, LinkedList, etc.) and any custom ones with the default constructor.
- Fixed an issue in OAuthClientFilter causing it to ask for a new request token instead of resuming the authentication after the authentication flow gets suspended to retrieve the verifier code.
- Fixed issues 65, 166, 220
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-65
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-166
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-220
  Extended the functionality of PostReplaceFilter to add support for:
    - specifying the overriding method in the query parameter (besides the existing header support)
    - configuration property, so that user can choose if both the header as well as the query param should be supported
    - converting form parameters to query parameters in case of overriding to GET
- Fixed issues 506 and 760
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-506
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-760
  Improved heuristics to determine if servlet extension or path mapping was used. Passing the full servlet path to the resources if extension mapping is used.

release 1.9 (09-2011)
- Fixed issue 761
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-761
  Fix typo in com.sun.jersey.api.core.ResourceConfig
- Cross-Site Request Forgery protection filters were added to jersey-server and jersey-client. On the server side, the filter checks for the custom header X-Requested-By for any potentially state changing methods (i.e. methods other than GET, HEAD and OPTIONS). If the header is not present, bad request error is returned to the client. The client side filter ensures the X-Requested-By header is added to the requests.
- Wadl generator capable of generating XML schemas for params is used by default from now.
- Added support for Freemarker templates, see contribs/jersey-freemarker and samples/freemarker
- Fixed issue 755
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-755
  Wadl javadoc tag - response doc wasn't processed correctly in all cases

- Fixed issue 697
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-697
  Scope of the dependency on Jersey Grizzly2 module in Jersey Guice module updated to "test".
- Fixed issue 722

  NullPointerException instead of IllegalArgumentException when passing null name to UriBuilder.replaceMatrixParam()
- Fixed issue 716
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-716
  NullPointerException when passing null to values argument of UriBuilder.replaceMatrixParam()
- *Breaking change*: Added support for 2-legged OAuth in oauth-server module.
  As a result, 2 new methods were added to the OAuthConsumer interface: getPrincipal()
  and isInRole() - these are used by the security context in case of 2-legged oauth
  (i.e. no token in the oauth header). Existing users of the previous versions of
  the oauth-server module should add a simple implementation of getPrincipal() always
  returning null to their impl. of the OAuthConsumer interface, and an implementation
  of isInRole() method always returning false.
- Fixed issue 721
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-721
  NullPointerException during WADL generation with @Autowired Spring beans

- Added support for specifying XML header in XML responses by attaching XmlHeader annotation to the resource method.
- Fixed issue 649
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-649

  Use following maven targets to compile, instrument, test and
  generate reports:
    mvn clean install -Dcobertura -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    mvn cobertura:cobertura -Dcobertura
- Fixed issue 643
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-643
  Allowing users to use different client implementation in Jersey test
  framework. It might be done by providing ClientFactory and overriding
  method getClientFactory in JerseyTest, which respects priority of
  container provided client OR override getClient() method to gain
  absolute control.
- Provided a workaround for issue 639
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-639
  Jersey allows to hack HttpURLConnection class and injects (via reflection)
  HTTP method which will be used to "method" field. This approach disables
  method name control which is used in setMethod method. Users have to set
  URLConnectionClientHandler.PROPERTY_HTTP_URL_CONNECTION_SET_METHOD_WORKAROUND
  property to true to activate this workaround. There is also one know
  limitation - request can't contain entity when this code is executed.
- Jackson dependency upgrade: 1.5.5 -> 1.7.1
- Fixed issue 626
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-626
  Skipping the leading CRLF for the first boundary delimiter in multipart
  messages.

  Jersey now adds a whitespace after the semicolon separating the content
  type parameters.
- Grizzly 2 http-server support moved from the experimental
  area to the new jersey-grizzly2 module in the com.sun.jersey space
- *Breaking change*: Grizzly 1 support in a separate module
  Grizzly 1 support used to be part of the jersey-server module
  This is no longer the case. If you rely on Grizzly 1 you will
  need to use the jersey-grizzly dependency instead of just jersey-server 
- Re-fixed issue 320
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-320
  Interning document parser needs to be used because of JAXB.
- *Breaking change*: Fixed issue 607
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-607
  OAuthProvider is no longer registered using the init param property.
  It needs to be added as any other provider (e.g. by binding it).

- Fixed issue 596
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-596
  When serializing parameters of the content-disposition header include a
  ' ' after the '; ' as this improves interoperability with services or clients
  that do not correctly parse content-disposition headers.
- Fixed issue 598
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-598
  The Vary header is set if a call to Request.selectVariant is called.
- Fixed issue 600
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-600
  Report errors if CDI-based Jersey injection targets for cannot be obtained.
- Fixed issue 597
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-597
  The Errors class correctly cleans up the thread local state to stop
  class loader leaking when deploying Web applications.
- Fixed issue 522
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-522
  The Request.selectVariant supports the quality of source "qs" parameter on
  media type variant.
- Fixed issue 206
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-206
  WADL resource params must also be supported 
  for resource class fields or resource class bean properties
- Fixed issue 289
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-289
  The filter init param "com.sun.jersey.config.feature.FilterContextPath" can
  be used to declare a filter context path.
  For example if the URL pattern of the Jersey configured filter is
  "/filterContext/*" and the param value is "/filterContext" then the base URI
  of the application is defined to be
  "http(s)://host:port/contextPath/filterContextPath/".
  Note that an init param is required because the Servlet 2.x API does not
  provide access to the URI pattern defined in the web.xml.
- Fixed issue 452
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-452
  It is an error if a resource class is annotated with more than one
  Jersey-based scope annotation e.g. @Singleton and @PerRequest.
- Fixed issue 595
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-595
  When mapping exceptions to responses if the Log level is FINE when the
  exception will be logged. This changes the current behaviour where the
  exception was logged when tracing was enabled. Thus when Jersey is used
  as a filter with tracing enabled 404 mapped exceptions will not be logged.
- Fixed issue 587
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-587
  Upgrade to tag lib version 1.2 for Jersey's JSP support.
- Fixed issue 487
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-487

  structure declaration, not as their real representation in final http
  request.
- Fixed issue 593
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-593
  Changed internal matching request to utilize an empty InputStream rather
  than a null value.
- Fixed issue 592
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-592
  Documented the GlassFish servlet initialization parameter
    org.glassfish.web.isDefaultErrorPageEnabled
  that can be used to disable GlassFish default error page support.
- Fixed issue 590
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-590
  Added check before adding container notifier for existing ones and add them
  to new set and move this from ServletCointaner.initiate to configure
  Moved reload functionality to scanning resource config, cache last scanning
  results and use them to compute added/removed classes and reflect this change
  in newly scanned set.
- Fixed issue 589
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-589
  Related to https://glassfish.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=13649
  Checking "assignability" before actually creating instance of class
  found using ServiceFinder to prevent classloading issues.
- Fixed issue 478
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-478
  Applies when marshalling a collection to JSON and MAPPED or NATURAL JSON notations
  are used. A JSON array is generated if root unwrapping is set to true.
  Otherwise, if root unwrapping is set to false, a JSON object is returned.

release 1.4 (11-09-2010)
- Fixed issue 431
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-431
  The use of @PerSession no longer results in a NotSerializableException when 
  session state is persisted for internal state, associated with resource
  instances, that is stored as a session attribute.
- Fixed issue 554
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-554
  Tracing is enabled for the JSP template processor. The JSP name and reference
  to the it variable is output.
- Fixed issue 571
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-571
  User defined providers (MessageBodyReaders and Writers) must have higher
  priority than Jersey provided ones (client & server side).
- When ServletContainer.FEATURE_FILTER_FORWARD_ON_404 is enabled
  and the status code is 404 call HttpServletResponse.setStatus otherwise
  call HttpServletResponse.sendError.
- Fixed issue 578
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-578
  The async client, when no HTTP async implementation is utilized, uses
  ExecutorService to execute the request/response task.
  The default implementation is Executors.newCachedThreadPool() and the
  implementation can be set on the Client.
- Fixed issue 577
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-577
  When a client sends an empty request to a resource method that consumes
  JAXB/JSON the natural and mapped conventions produce inconsistent results and
  should return a 400 error.
- Fixed issue 546
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-546
  Validating default values with @DefaultValue of an @*Param at initialization
  time to produce on errors on deployment can be avoided if the StringReader
  is annotated with @StringReader.@ValidateDefaultValue(false). In such cases
  if the default value is incorrect it will result in a runtime error.
- Fixed issue 552
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-552
  Support null key values (as documented) for KeyComparatorHashMap.
- Fixed issue 550
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-550
  When a WebApplicationException is thrown because a message body reader/writer
  cannot be found a message is included with the exception (in addition to that
  message being logged).
- Fixed issue 575
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-575
  Fixed regression in jersey-multipart where @FormDataParam annotated parameters
  were not being recognized resulting in deployment errors or incorrect
  information being passed as the entity parameter.
- Fixed issue 573
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-573
  Entities that are defined to be parameterized types with type variable as
  arguments will be resolved, recursively to concrete types where possible.
  For, example List<T> T[], Map<T, T> and Map<T, List<T>> will be resolved,
  when T is a String, to List<String> String[], Map<String, String> and
  Map<String, List<String>>
- Fixed issue 572
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-572
  Propagate security context when making internal invocations to match URIs.
- Fixed issue 564
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-564
  Modified field injection so that injection will occur independent of the
  field value. Previously injection would only occur if the field value
  was null.
- Support @InjectParam, which has the same semantics as Jersey's @Inject
  but does not conflict with the JSR 330 version. Jersey's @Inject is now
  deprecated.
- Support for @ParentRef to injecting a parent into a sub-resource.
- Fixed issue 563
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-563
  When using the low-level Grizzly container injection of GrizzlyRequest
  and GrizzlyResponse are now supported as follows:
    @Context ThreadLocal<GrizzlyRequest> request
    @Context ThreadLocal<GrizzlyResponse> response
  The thread local is required because GrizzlyRequest/Response are classes,
  not interfaces, and therefore cannot be proxied using the Java proxy API.
- Fixed issue 562
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-562
  When ServletContainer.FEATURE_FILTER_FORWARD_ON_404 feature is set to true
  and Jersey forwards to the next filter in the chain then the response
  status code will be set to 200 before forwarding.
- JSONConfiguration.FEATURE_POJO_MAPPING ResourceConfig feature introduced
  to simplify Jackson POJO entity provider utilization
  Users no longer need to register the Jackson provider explicitly
- Jackson dependency upgraded to version 1.5.5 
- *Breaking change*: in order to prevent OSGi bundle reload issues
  we need to bundle JSR-311 API classes with the jersey-core module
- Fixed issue 486
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-486
  Added JRebel support.
- Fixed issue 542
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-542
  Added client HTTPDigestAuthFilter from external contributor + tests
- Fixed issue 549
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-549
  Implicit HEAD method support was not re-using any resource method-specific
  filters on the GET method from which the HEAD method was derived from.
- Fixed issue 547
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-547
  The GZIPContentEncodingFilter works correctly with the Client API and
  HttpURLConnection when a request entity is sent for which the size is known
  in advance, for example a File or byte[].
- Fixed issue 506
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-506
  Fixed regression. Servlet url patterns of the form
        <url-pattern>*.xxx</url-pattern>
  now function as was the case for Jersey 1.0.3.1.

release 1.3 (17-06-2010)
- Fixed issue 540
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-540
  Parameterized types of List/Set/SortedSet are supported for parameters,
  for example @QueryParam("d") List<List<String>>, if there is a
  StringReaderProvider registered that supports the type List<String>.
- Remove the restriction that a GET method cannot receive entities. Warnings
  will be presented instead of errors. Although this is highly uncommon The HTTP
  spec does not rule this out thus Jersey was being unduly restrictive.
- Fixed issue 543
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-543
  unable to build extended-wadl-webapp sample
- Fixed issue 293
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-293
  The response building will retain the StatusType (if explictly set) or those
  defined on javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status. The container may access the
  StatusType via ContainerResponse.getStatusType and from that the reason
  phrase can be obtained.
  The servlet container will use the reason phrase for the message parameter
  of the call to HttpServletResponse.sendError for the case when the
  status code >= 400 and the servlet container is deployed as a servlet
  (sendError does not work on some web containers when the servlet container is
  deployed as a filter).
- Fixed issue 472
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-472
  Ensure that preconditions with GET then a PUT with If-Unmodified-Since works
  correctly at the granularity of seconds.
  The last modified date is rounded down to the nearest second when comparing
  against If-Modified-Since or If-Unmodified-Since values.
  (HTTP formatted dates are rounded down to the nearest second.)
  This can result in lost updates if two or more PUTs occur within an interval
  of a second. The application should use etags in such cases.
- ServiceFinder will defer to the defining class loader of the current class
  if a provider class cannot be loaded from the thread context class loader.
- Changed the declaration of components defined by jersey-multipart to use
  the META-INF/services service interface name to avoid the components being
  output in the logs.
- Fixed issue 488
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-488
  When using Apache HTTP client, chunked encoding and jersey-multipart
  it is necessary for the client to explicitly declare the boundary string for 
  the content type. See com.sun.jersey.multipart.Boundary and
  com.sun.jersey.multipart.MultiPartMediaTypes.
  This is due to architectural restrictions with the Apache HTTP client as
  the headers have to be declared before the entity is written.
- Removed support for resource methods utilizing @FormParam and consuming
  "multipart/form-data". This functionality has been replaced by @FormDataParam
  in the jersey-multipart module.
- Fixed issue 531
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-531
  WADL generation should not modify the abstract model when @FormParam is
  declared in a resource method parameter and the @Consumes is absent.
- Fixed issue 538
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-538
  The reference to the registered application may be injected as follows:
    @Context Application app;
- Upgrade the version of Abdera used in the contribs/jersey-atom-abdera to 1.0.
- Guice integration supports the @Inject binding of common
  JAX-RS and Jersey dependencies such as UriInfo and ExtendedUriInfo.
  Extend from com.sun.jersey.guice.JerseyServletModule, instead of
  com.google.inject.servlet.ServletModule, to register these bindings.
- GlassFish v3 integration
  Instead of one big uber JAR, jersey-gf-bundle.jar, individual Jersey modules 
  are integrated to GlassFish to allow better modularization
  and alignment with non GlassFish environment
- Fixed issue 436
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-436
  Resources may be looked up using a URI via methods on 
  com.sun.jersey.api.core.ResourceContext.
- Fixed issue 489
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-489
  Support configurable namespace separators for JAXB/JSON.
  See com.sun.jersey.api.json.JSONConfiguration#nsSeparator
- Fixed Jersey versioning issue for GlassFish when a version of
  Jersey is deployed in the war that is different to the version of Jersey
  version distributed with GlassFish.
  META-INF/sevices files will be ignored if the corresponding
  META-INF/MANIFEST.MF of the same jar contains a Bundle-SymbolicName
  beginning with "com.sun.jersey" and a Bundle-Version that is not equal
  to the Bundle-Version declared in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF for the same jar
  that contains the com.sun.jersey.spi.service.ServiceFinder.class.
- Fixed issue 66
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-66
  *Breaking changes*
  Errors will result if dependencies cannot be injected rather than a null
  value being injected.
  Non-static inner classes as root resource and provider classes are no longer
  supported.
- Fixed issue for WadlGeneratorConfig and building of properties, which now
  correctly works for any property value type.
- Fixed issue 527
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-527
  Package name scanning now works in an OSGi environment
- Jersey Test Framework
  Adding support for setting servlet and concurrent filter(s) with possibility

- Fixed issue 526
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-526
  Provide access to the matching AbstractResourceMethod that was invoked
  on a resource class, see ExtendedUriInfo.getMatchedMethod().
- Fixed issue 529
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-529
  Close input stream when reading properties file to obtain the Build ID.
- Fixed issue 509
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-509
  The stack trace is no longer included as the response entity for an
  unmapped WebApplicationException with a status code of 500 and no response
  entity.
- Fixed issue 521
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-520
  Support matching when quality of source, qs, values are less than 1.
- Fixed issue 520
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-520
  When Guice support is configured enable Guice injection of resource
  or provider classes that have fields or methods annotated with @Inject
  but have no constructor annotated with @Inject. In this case Jersey
  instiaties and manages and lets Guice inject.
- Fixed issue 449
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-449
  When a message body reader or writer cannot be found for a media type
  and Java type log all readers/writers that are compatible with that
  media type.

release 1.2 (10-05-2010)
- Fixed issue 457
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-457
  Jersey WAR project cannot be deployed on OSGI platform
- Fixed issue 275
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-275
  Jersey-core, jersey-server, jersey-client and jersey-json modules 
  now (from 1.2 verison on) contain OSGi headers and use ServiceMix based
  implementation to work in OSGi environment.
  2 examples were added to show how to build a Jersey based OSGi web application
  using OSGi Http-Service and OSGi WAR deployment. 
  Known limitation: the package name resource configuration can not be used in the OSGi runtime
  and needs to be replaced by the class name based mechanism.
  This will be addressed in future development. Also other Jersey modules 
  are to be OSGified in the future releases.
- Fixed issue 516
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-516
  Changed resolving algorithm for finding a CDI Bean from a Class such
  that inheritence hierarchies are supported.
  BeanManager.resolve does not resolve a set of Bean to one Bean if all
  members extend from a common concrete case class.
- Fixed issue 507
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-507
  Support DELETE with request entities for the Apache HTTP client.
- Fixed issue 505
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-505
  Fixed error in the multipart message body writer when the
  Content-Type header value is explicitly set and the value is a string.
- Fixed issue 504
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-504
  Upgrade Simple HTTP server to 4.1.20.
- Fixed issue 484
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-484
  Change the Guice dependency to depend on Guice from the maven central
  repository rather than GuiceyFruit.
- Added com.sun.jersey.api.JResponse, which is a type safe alternative to
  javax.ws.rs.core.Response that preserves the type information of response
  entity thus it is not necessary to utilize javax.ws.rs.core.GenericEntity.
  It provides equivalent functonality to Response.
  JResponse may be extended in combination with JResponse.AJResponseBuilder
  specialization when building responses.
- Fixed issue 485, 519
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-485
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-519
  When a ServletContainer is used as a servlet filter and the feature
  ServletContainer.FEATURE_FILTER_FORWARD_ON_404 is set to true then enable the
  next filter in the chain to be invoked if Jersey or the application returns a
  404 with no entity body.
  *Breaking changes* in order to support Servlet 2.4 and Servlet 3.0 it was
  necessary to change the return type of ServletContainer#service(
    URI baseUri, URI requestUri,
    final HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  from "void" to "int" such that it returns the state code of the response.
  HttpServletResponse.getStatusCode only exists for Servlet 3.0.
- Fixed issue 361
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-361
  Introduced new feature (FeaturesAndProperties.FEATURE_XMLROOTELEMENT_PROCESSING)
  which enables getting XmlRootElement annotations and deriving name for list
  from its name property. First letter "decapitalization" is not done
  when this feature is enabled.
- Fixed issue 480
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-480
  An error in the decoding of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" information
  will result in a 400 (Client error) response.
- Fixed issue 471
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-471
  LoggingFilter should not have side-effects on the response and retain
  content length information.
- Allow injection of the Client instance onto client-managed provider
  classes.
- Fixed issue 475
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-475
  A registered application can return null for getClasses and getSingletons
  which has the same meaning as returning an empty set.
- Fixed issue 479
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-479
  Fixed package scanning for applications deployed to the WebLogic application
  server.
- Fixed issue 477
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-477
  Added null check for value returned from ServletContext.getResourcePaths.
- Jersey Test Framework modularization
  You can choose which container would be used for testing by depending on that
  module. For example if you want to use InMemory container, specify dependency
  like:
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.sun.jersey.jersey-test-framework</groupId>
            <artifactId>jersey-test-framework-inmemory</artifactId>
            <version>${project.version}</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

  and it will be used. When you define multiple dependencies and grizzly module
  (default) is present, tests will run on grizzly; otherwise (grizzly module is
  not present) warning will be produced and tests will run on first discovered
  module. This can be altered by specifying jersey.test.containerFactory property
  and setting its value to TestContainer descendant (fully qualified java class
  name).
- Upgrade from Grizzly 1.9.8 to Grizzly 1.9.18-i
- Fixed issue 465
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-465
  Refactored ResourceConfig; now its possible to use delimiters ';', ',' and ' '
  (space) to separate class names in various init parameters like filters and
  filter factories declaration, classpath, class and package names specification.
  Intended consequence is that FilterFactory now uses ResourceConfig to get list
  of filters/filter factories so its possible to programatically add filters
  to ones defined in web.xml.
- Modified the resolving of "flat-file" templates so the location is
    '/' + resourceClass.getName().replace('.', '/').replace('$', '.') + '.' + path
  Thus if there is a resource class named com.Foo and there is an index.html
  template then the path to the template can be:
    com/Foo.index.html
  in addition to:
    com/Foo/index.html
  Thus templates can be co-located with Java class files rather than in
  sub-directories.
- Fixed issue 461
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-461
  An exception thrown from a resource method that is mapped to a response
  will have the appropriate Content-Type set, if an entity is present and if not
  already set from the mapped response, as declared by the @Produces annotation
  and what the client accepts.
- Fixed issue 433
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-433
  OAuth signature calculation correctly encodes request parameters according
  to the unreserved character set defined in the URI specifications.
  RSA_SHA1 support correctly URL encodes the base64 encoding of the signature.
- Fixed issue 468
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-468
  If URI canonicalization, and optionally URI normalization is set to true, but
  redirection is set to false (the default) then the request URI is modified to
  be the canonicalized, and optionally normalized, URI.
- Fixed issue 464
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-464
  Change the context related methods from private to protected.
- Fixed issue 466
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-466
  Avoid generation of empty params in WADL.
- Fixed issue 459
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-459
  A 307 (Temporary redirect) response for a resource which has a path
  ending in '/' has a correct full request URI, including query parameters (if present),
  for the Location header.
- Fixed issue 467
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-467
  @Inject can be utilized on provider-based classes.

release 1.1.5 (20-01-2010)
- Fixed issue 437
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-437
  Support the parsing of the Cache-Control header.
- Fixed issue 454
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-454
  Scanning of classes WEB-INF/classes in a war in ear now works for JBoss 5.x
  deployments.
- Fixed issue 456
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-456
  UriBuilder can be built from URIs whose authority component is a
  registry based naming authority.
- When tracing is enabled exceptions that are mapped to responses will be
  logged.
- Added formatted support when JSON with natural notation is used
- Fixed issue 362
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-362
  Deprecated HttpHelper.getAcceptLangauge and added new method
  HttpHelper.getAcceptLanguage.
- Fixed issue 448
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-448
  Ensure that spring 2.5.x dependency version does not depend on Spring 3.0.
- Fixed issue 450
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-450
  Equals method of AsyncWebResource was incorrect.
- Fixed issue 202
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-202
  Support the quality source parameter, "qs", on media types declared with
  @Produces or @ImplicitProduces.
  The media type, M say, with the highest quality source parameter for a request
  will be selected as the most acceptable media type if X is an acceptable
  media type.
  For example, given the following resource class:
  public class Foo {
    @Produces("application/xml")
    String get() { ... }

    @Produces("text/html;qs=2")
    String get() { ... }
  }
  and given an Accept header of "*/*" or "application/xml, text/*;q=0.8"
  then "text/html" will be produced because the application prefers "text/html"
  over "application/xml" even though the client does not.
  Given an Accept header of "application/xml" then "application/xml" will be
  produced.
- Fixed issue 382
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-382
  Quality source parameters, "qs", on media types declared with @Produces or
  @ImplicitProduces on resource classes will work correctly for an
  Accept header of "*/*"
- Fixed issue 446
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-447
  Deprecated TemplateProcessor, instead use ViewProcessor, which provides
  better support when resolving a template name and writing out a template.
  Note that existing implementations of TemplateProcessor are still supported.
  When writing out an view with an absolute template name, or a view with a
  resolving class then it is not required that an HTTP request be in scope
  (unless the ViewProcessor implementation requires it).
  *BREAKING CHANGES* for com.sun.jersey.spi.template.TemplateContext and
  com.sun.jersey.spi.template.ResolvedViewable.
  TemplateContext no longer has a method to obtain the set of TemplateProcessor.
  The constructors of ResolvedViewable were modified to be compatible with
  ViewProcessor.
- Fixed issues when a Response is returned with a Viewable and a status code
  >= 400.
- Fixed issue 447
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-447
  JAX-RS annotated methods on interfaces or abstract methods on abstract classes
  that have parameters that are instances of java.lang.reflect.TypeVariable are
  correctly detected as the annotated methods to process.
- Fixed issue 439
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-432
  Servlet RequestDispatcher.forward works when forwarding to Jersey managed
  URIs. For example a JSP view may utilize <c:import url="/some/jaxrs/path" />
  to include another view.
- Added formatted feature, see FeaturesAndProperties.FEATURE_FORMATTED
  When enabled, XML returned from resources will be formatted (line breaks and
  indentation).
- Fixed issue 439
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-439
  Proxied objects, using java.lang.reflect.Proxy, that invoke the Java method
  of the proxy will correctly re-throw any target exception caught from a
  InvocationTargetException, rather than the proxying throwing a
  java.lang.reflect.UndeclaredThrowableException.
- Upgraded jersey-simple-server to version 4.1.15.
- If an exception is mapped to a Response then that exception is now available
  from the HttpResponseContext.getMappedThrowable() method.
- Fixed issue 379
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-379
  Jersey applications can now be deployed on Google App Engine.
- Added tracing feature.
  Tracing provides useful information that describes how a request
  is processed and dispatched to JAX-RS/Jersey components. This can aid
  debugging when the application is not behaving as expected either
  because of a bug in the application code or in the Jersey code.
  Trace messages will be output as response headers with a header name of the
  form "X-Jersey-Trace-XXX", where XXX is a decimal value corresponding to the
  trace message number, and a header value that is the trace message.
  See ResourceConfig.FEATURE_TRACE and ResourceConfig.FEATURE_TRACE_PER_REQUEST.
  Tracing can be abled for a web application by adding the following init-param:
    <init-param>
        <param-name>com.sun.jersey.config.feature.Trace</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </init-param>
- Added new feature - now its possible to set language mappings via
  ResourceConfig property (ResourceConfig.PROPERTY_LANGUAGE_MAPPINGS);
  this can be set as a parameter in web.xml file.
  Allowed types are String and String[], format: "segment:language-tag".
  Language tag is defined in RFC 2616 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).
    language-tag  = primary-tag *( "-" subtag )
    primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA
    subtag        = 1*8ALPHA
- Added new feature - now its possible to set media type mappings via
  ResourceConfig property (ResourceConfig.PROPERTY_MEDIA_TYPE_MAPPINGS);
  this can be set as a parameter in web.xml file.
  Allowed types are String and String[], format: "segment:media/type".
  Multiple definitions are comma separated. This was implemented mainly
  to match similar RESTEasy feature.
- Fixed issue 430
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-430
  Fixed injection of per-request resources on to per-request (non-299)
  managed beans.
- Fixed issue 429
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-429
  Package scanning deployment on JBoss 5.x app servers now works correctly.
- Fixed issue 32
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-32
  The servlet container supports portable scannnig of WEB-INF/lib and
  WEB-INF/classes directories when the default servlet configuration is
  utilized.
  Default configuration deployments will now work on WebLogic-based
  application servers.
- Fixed issue 421
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-421
  ContainerResponse.write() now consistently sets the isCommitted state.
- Fixed issue 420
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-420
  Some servlet containers do not support the addition of headers after
  a HttpServletResponse.sendError is invoked.
  Jersey will invoke sendError for a response status code >=400 when there
  is no response entity. The headers are now written before sendError is
  invoked.
- Fixed issue 419
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-419
  Upgraded simple server to version 4.1.14.
- Fixed issue 422
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-422
  The container response filter of the server-side LoggingFilter now ensures
  that when the ServletContainer is utilized response headers are written when
  there is no response entity present.
  This was a regression as the ContainerResponseAdapter of the LoggingFilter
  was not correctly adapting the finish method.
- Fixed issue 423
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-423
  Injection on to 299 managed beans in the dependent scope (scope is managed
  by Jersey) is correctly supported for Jersey-based injection artifacts
  such as @Context ResourceContext and @Inject T.
- Fixed issue 125
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-125
  @FormParam injection is supported for the same targets as other @*Param
  annotations. Injection will only occur if there is a request entity
  of the type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", otherwise an
  IllegalStateException will be thrown.
  Form parameter beans are now supported, and the 
  @com.sun.jersey.spi.inject.Inject annotation may now be utilized to obtain
  such beans, for example:
    class MyFormBean {
       @FormParam("a") String a;
       @FormParam("b") String b;
    }

    @Path("foo")
    class MyResource {
      @POST
      public ... post(@Inject MyFormBean b) { ... }
    }
- Fixed issue 424
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-424
  The @com.sun.jersey.spi.inject.Inject annotation may now be utilized to inject
  a resource class.
  This is the recommend over the approach of using ResourceContext.
  If a per-request managed resource is required to be injected into a
  singleton managed resource then the resource class can be declared as the
  parameterized type of Injectable, for example:
    @Inject Injectable<MyPerRequestResource>
- Fixed issue 418
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-418
  Reloading of the servlet container no longer retains previous references to
  root reosurce and provider classes declared in an extension of Application
  or ResourceConfig.
  The root cause: the WebApplication implementation was not cloning the
  ResourceConfig instance passed to it on initiation if additional
  root resource and provider classes needed to be added.
- Added examples from Bill Burke's book "RESTful Java with JAX-RS"
  modified to be runnable with Jersey and with additional tests.
- Apache HTTP Client now supports custom HTTP methods.

release 1.1.4 (2009-11)
- Fixed issue 412
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-412
  Ensure that ResourceConfig and extensions of retain the order of
  classes and singletons that are added.
- Fixed issue 411
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-411
  Fixed regression in MethodList class caused by fixing issue 229.
- Fixed issue 229
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-229
  @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy method can have any visibility.
- Fixed issue 406
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-406
  FormDataBodyPart.getValue will honor the charset parameter of the media
  type associated with the body part.
- Fixed issue 232
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-232
  The characters '{' and '}' are percent encoded if a URI is built using
  UriBuilder.build and no template parameter values are given as input.
- Fixed issue 357
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-357
  The Apache HTTP client handler for the Client API will automatically
  release the connection if no response entity is present. Thus it is not
  necessary to call ClientResponse.close if the response has no entity.
  This avoids the client blocking when all the threads of the connection
  manager are utilized.
- Fixed issue 384
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-384
  Work around issue in the LW HTTP server:
    http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6886436
  for responses that return a 204 status code. This issue can manifest
  itself if, for example, a client invokes a POST method that returns 204
  then invokes a GET method. This may cause some clients to hang, specifically
  HttpURLConnection (browsers and the Apache HTTP client do not hang).
- Fixed issue 397
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-397
  Fixed issue for JSON/JAXB mapped marshalling that results in a stack
  overflow if the client aborts the connection when marshalling is in
  operation.
- Fixed issue 393
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-393
  Headers may be added to the multi-valued map returned from 
  Response.getMetadata().
- Fixed issue 391
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-390
  The Jersey servlet-layer catches a MappableContainerException and will
  rethrow the cause wrapped in a ServletException. This ensures that such
  mappable exceptions can be mapped by the Web application.
- Fixed issue 390
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-390
  A com.sun.jersey.api.container.MappableContainerException may be thrown
  from an ExceptionMapper and as such that expception will be re-thrown to
  the underlying HTTP container.
  The EJBException mapper was modified to throw a MappableContainerException
  with the cause of an EJBException. This ensures that such runtime exceptions
  can be mapped by the Web application.
- Fixed issue 389
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-389
  For Web applications HttpServletResponse.sendError will be called instead
  of HttpServletResponse.setStatus under the following conditions:
  1) no bytes have been written to the response output stream; and
  2) the status code is an error code, namely a value >= 400.
  Such behaviour ensures that error pages mapped to error codes declared in the
  web.xml will work if Jersey or the applicaton returns an error code with no
  entity.
- Fixed issue 387
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-387
  Enabling Jersey response logging with views no longer results in an
  illegal state exception.
- Fixed issue 388
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-388
  Maven web-based archetypes use version 2.5 of web.xml.
- Fixed issue 392
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-392
  Issue 336 (fixed in 1.1.3-ea) caused a regression such that it was no longer 
  possible to register provider classes in an Application, a ResourceConfig or
  a ResourceConfigurator.
- Fixed issue 95
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-95
  The recursive cycle detection has been modified to be local to root
  resource classes such the same sub-resource in two or more root resource
  classes can be declared in the WADL.
- Fixed issue 371
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-371
  Logging of stack trace of mapped exceptions is not performed.
- Fixed issue 385
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-385
  Enable non-JAX-RS annotations on interface or abstract methods and
  parameters to be merged with the annotations on the concrete method and 
  parameters (if such annotations are not already declared).
- Fixed issue 383
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-383
  Singleton instances added to the set of singletons of the Application/
  ResourceConfig are not longer errornousaly instantiated by the runtime.
  The singleton reference is also available from the
  ResourceContent.getResource.
- Fixed issue 381
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-381
  Multiple child spring configuration fails may be declared as a value
  of the property SpringServlet.CONTEXT_CONFIG_LOCATION.
- Modified the Jersey test framework such that it is possible to override
  JerseyTest. The external test container supports the system property
  JERSEY_HOST_NAME to declare the host name for the base URI.

release 1.1.3-ea (2009-10-06)
- Support configuration of ResourceConfig using the provider interface
  com.sun.jersey.api.core.ResourceConfigurator.
  One or more ResourceConfigurator providers may be registered and the
  configure method will be called which may update the state of the
  ResourceConfig instance passed as a parameter.
- Support programmatic modification of the declaration of filters. See the
  following methods on ResourceConfig: getContainerRequestFilters,
  getContainerResponseFilters and getResourceFilterFactories.
- Support the resolving of a type variable, T say, to a concrete type for
  all parameters (field, method parameters, method setters) and
  return types of resource methods.
  Log warnings if T cannot be resolved to a concreate type, or if a
  parameterized type, Collection<T> say, cannot be resolved because such
  a type cannot be created dynamically.
- Added support for Servlet 3.0 deployment with JAX-RS 1.1-ea.
- Fixed issue 363
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-363
  Fixed for parameters when a String-based constructor is utlized with a
  @DefaultValue("").
- Fixed issue 359
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-359
  The client API should use the default media type "application/octet-stream"
  if a default media type cannot be obtained for a request entity of Java type.
- Fixed issue 336
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-336
  A class that extends of Application or ResourceConfig referenced in the web.xml
  is now instantated as a component.
  If the class has a constructor that takes a single parameter of the
  type Map then the class is instantiated with that constructor and an instance
  of Map that contains all the initialization parameters is passed as the
  parameter. Otherwise, the class is instantiated as a singleton component
  managed by the runtime, and injection may be performed (the artifacts that
  may be injected are limited to injectable providers registered when
  the servlet or filter is configured).
- OAuth signature library now correctly percent encodes characters when
  generating a secret.
- Fixed issue 356
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-356
  Clarified JavaDoc for com.sun.jersey.core.header.MatchingEntityTag to
  state that instance of this type or the super type cannot be used to
  produce headers of the form "If-Match: *" or "If-None-Match: *".
- Fixed issue 357
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-357
  Clarifed JavaDoc for client API the response must be closed to ensure that
  underlying resources are correctly released.

release 1.1.2-ea (2009-08-25)
- Fixed issue 355
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-355
  URI conneg works for the case of when a suffix say "nt" is present
  in the path and is not preceded by a '.', for example "/ontology.nl
  URI conneg is now a container request filter, see:
  com.sun.jersey.api.container.filter.UriConnegFilter
  Developers may extend this filters and register it rather than utilizing the
  ResourceConfig.getMediaTypeMappings and ResourceConfig.getLanguageMappings.
- Fixed issue 354
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-354
  Runtime exceptions thrown from Singleton or Stateless Session Beans,
  such as WebApplicationException, will be mapped appropraitely.
- Fixed issue 353
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-353
  Form reading/writing will use the charset declared in the charset parameter
  of the media type if present, otherwise the UTF-8 charset will be utilized,
  to decode/encode characters.
- Fixed issue 250
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-250
  Updated the JavaDoc of HttpContext.getProperties and
  ContainerResponse.getProperties to state:
     * Care should be taken not to clear the properties or remove properties
     * that are unkown otherwise unspecified behaviour may result.
- Fixed issue 343

  The ResourceConfig property
    PROPERTY_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_COMPONENT_PROVIDER_FACTORY_CLASS
  additional supports a Java type that is a String whose value is a Class name.

  If an Content-Type header is recieved with an empty value a 400 
  response is returned.
- Fixed issue 350
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-350
  Errors when processing a parameter, annotated with an @*Param annotation,
  will result in an instance of ParamException (that extends WebApplicaton)
  being thrown concrete instance of which reflect the particular parameter
  involved.
  See com.sun.jersey.api.ParamException and inheriting classes for
  more details.

  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-338
  Ensure correct array element separator (',') is used also
  in case an array is recognized based on configuration option.
- Fixed issue 242
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-242
  Client and server logging now uses a JDK logger to log requests and
  responses.
- Code to copy a from an input stream or reader to an output stream or writer
  has been consolidated. In addition functions that require the use of byte
  or character arrays will use a default size for the array but this can
  be overridden if required (for performance reasons). See:
    com.sun.jersey.core.util.ReaderWriter
- Cleaned up the throwing of exceptions by message body readers and writers.
  If a known checked, or documented runtime, exception is thrown when
  reading then a WebApplcationException is thrown with the cause. If the
  exception is related to reading then a 400 (Client error) status code is
  set, otherwise a 500 (Internal server error) status code is set.
  If a known checked, or documented runtime, exception is thrown when
  writing then a WebApplcationException is thrown with the cause and a 
  500 (Internal server error) status code is set.
- Fixed issue when a Content-Type request header is absent and resource methods
  consume (explicitly or by default) "*/*".
  When a Content-Type request header is absent resource methods that consume
  "*/*" take priority over other reosurce methods that consume other media
  types. Thus "*/*" means consuming any media type or no media type.
  See also com.sun.jersey.core.provider.EntityHolder to safely consume a
  request entity if present, otherwise declare that such an entity is not
  present.
- Support for explcitly adding a root resource class or root resource singleton
  by programatically declaring the root path, rather than using the @Path
  annotation. See ResourceConfig.getExplicitRootResources for more details.
- Support the throwing of WebApplicationException from within a singleton
  or stateless session bean method. This will only work with GF v3 build 58
  or greater.
- Fixed issue 302
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-302
  Allow a relative template name to be resolved to an absolute template name
  that is a flat name if the template cannot be resolved the path-based
  rule.
  The flat name is fully qualified class name plus a "." plus the template name.
  For example, given the resolving class com.foo.MyResource and the template
  name index the absolute name will be "com.foo.MyResource.index.jsp".
- Fixed issue 161
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-161
  The Jersey client can now be used completely independently of the Jersey
  server side when errors are produces by certain message body readers and
  writers.
  Response and Response.ResponseBuilder are now implemented such that they
  can be used on the client side (without having to include jersey server
  dependencies). This is important for some message body readers and writers
  that may throw WebApplicationException, which in turn defers to Response
  for building a response.
- Fixed issue 337
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-337
  The LW HTTP container logs an IOException (passed from Jersey) and attempts
  to set the status code to 500. If the statuss and headers are already
  committed it is not possible to set the status code and the response will be
  terminated prematurely.
- Fixed issue 276
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-276
  Ensure that localized messages are correctly resolved in Web containers.
- Ensure that ContainerResponseWriter.finish is called consistently, for example
  when no response entity is present.
- Cleaned up declaration of checked exceptions from the abstract message body
  reader/writer classes for JAXB and removed the declaration of IOException.
- Fixed issue 334
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-334
  UriBuilder.segment and UriBuilder.matrixParam should percent encode ';'
  characters.
- Adding logging when Jersey cannot map an exception to a Response using
  registered ExceptionMapper and the exception gets re-thrown to the HTTP
  container.
- Fixed issue 280
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-280
  For the "natural" JSON convention, the humanReadableFormatting option
  now could be set, so that the output JSON contains new-line characters
  and indentation, which makes is easy to read for humans
- Upgraded Jackson library to the version 1.1.1, so that people
  relying on Jackson JAX-RS entity provider does not need to depend on two versions
  of the very same library at their applications 
- Fixed issue, working around a JDK bug in the method URL.toURI() when package
  scanning classes that are present in a directory path location containing

  ContainerRequest and ContainerResponse by may now be adapted from within
  filters by extending AdaptingContainerRequest and AdaptingContainerResponse
  respectively. The adapter CachedEntityContainerRequest is available for when
  a request entity instance consumed by a filter needs to be cached.
- The oauth modules at the java.net maven repository have moved from

  By default entity processing is disabled when XML parsing, on the client and
  server side, for JAXB types, SAXSource and DOMSource.
  This prevents Xml eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. Security defaults for XML

  Namespace support for mapped and natural JSON notations
    For the MAPPED convention, you would need to explicitly configure mapping
    of any possible namespaces URIs to JSON prefixes, using the xml2JsonNs method
    on the JSONConfiguration builder. No such configuration is needed for the
    NATURAL convention, as it leverages information provided by JAXB implementation.
    JAXB version 2.1.12 and better is needed.

  Suppport disabling of WADL. Set the following feature on ResourceConfig to
  true:
    ResourceConfig.FEATURE_DISABLE_WADL
  or add the following initialiation parameter to the Jersey servlet or filter:
    <init-param>
        <param-name>com.sun.jersey.config.feature.DisableWADL</param-name>
        <param-value>true</param-value>
    </init-param>

  Ensure that no double encoding of query or matrix components when building
  from a URI that contains a query or matrix component some parameters of
  which are replaced, for example:
    String uri = "http://localhost/query?limit=10&sql=select+*+from+users";
    URI u = UriBuilder.fromUri(uri).replaceQueryParam("limit", 100).build();
- Fixed issue 288
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-288
  ContextResolver instances injected or obtained from 
  Providers.getContextResolver now correctly aggregate registered
  ContextResolver implementations according to the specivity of the media type.
  If you have, say, three ContextResolver implementations:

    @Provider @Produces("application/foo")
    public class TypeResolver implements ContextResolver<MyContext> { ...}

    @Provider @Produces("application/*")
    public class SubTypeResolver implements ContextResolver<MyContext> { ...}

    @Provider @Produces("*/*")
    public class WildCardResolver implements ContextResolver<MyContext> { ...}

  The a call Providers.getContextResolver(...), such as follows:

    MediaType m = MediaType.valueOf("application/foo");
    Object someType = ...
    Providers p = ...
    ContextResolver<MyContext> cr = p.getContextResolver(
       MyContext.class, m);
    if (cr != null) {
      MyContext c = cr.get(someType);
    }

  will result in a ContextResolver<MyContext> implementation that is an
  aggregate of TypeResolver, SubTypeResolver, WildCardResolver, where each is
  checked in order according to the specificity of the produces media types.

  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-282
  The file META-INF/services/jersey-server-components may be present and
  contain root resource and provider class names for classes that
  should be loaded and deployed. If a class cannot be loaded then a deployment
  error will occur.
  The file META-INF/services/jersey-client-components may be present and contain
  provider clases for classes that should be loaded and work with the client API.
  If a class cannot be loaded then an error will occur.
- Fixed issue 279
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-279
  Updated the dependencies document to include the dependencies required
  when list List<T> or Collection<T> where T is a JAXB bean. A StaX
  implementation is required, such as Woodstox.
- Fixed issue 314
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-314
  Support MessageBodyReader/Writer implementations have declarations as follows:
    @Provider
    public class MyWriter<T> implements MessageBodyWriter<T> { ... }
  namely the type variable T is never resolved and will be resolved to Object
  when instantiated.
- Fixed issue 297
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-297
  If a servlet URL mapping is something like "/foo/*" and the request URL
  path is "/foo" then Jersey will consume the request as if the path was "/foo/",
  unless the redirect feature is enabled (see features of ResourceConfig),
  which if the case, then Jersey will return a temporary redirect response to
  the URL with the path "/foo/".
- Fixed issue 295
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-295
  Inheritence of Spring annotated classes, using @Component, that are also
  resource classes is now supported, for example:
    @Path("a") @Component
    public static class A {
        @GET public String get() {
            return "a";
        }
    }

    @Path("b") @Component
    public static class B extends A {
        @GET @Override public String get() {
            return "b";
        }
    }
- Fixed issue 285
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-285
  A spring configuration file may be declared as a child context in the

  The support JSONObject and JSONArray should only work for JSON related
  media types, namely "application/json" and "application/<something>+json".
- Fixed issue 154
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-154
  The com.sun.jersey.core.provider.EntityHolder type may be utilized as a 
  "meta-entity" to determine whether a request consumed by the server, or a 
  response consumed by the client, contains the entity or contains no entity, 
  for example:
     @POST
     @Consumes("text/plain")
     public void post(EntityHolder<MyJAXBObject> s) {
         if (s.hasEntity()) {
             MyJAXBObject entity = s.getEntity();

release 1.1.0-ea (2009-05-04)
- Fixed issue 283
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-283
  Removed race condition that may occur when concurrently creating the 
  meta-data for a resource class.
- Added security sample - https service with http basic authentication on
  GlassFish 2.x
- Fixed issue 278
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-278
  com.sun.jersey.api.client.filter.HTTPBasicAuthFilter was not correctly
  using "=" for padding characters when base 64 encoding the basic string
  derived from the user name and password.
- Fixed issue 151
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-151
  Added the following to ClientResponse:
  - enum Status, containing all known HTTP status codes
  - ClientResponse.getClientResponseStatus() that returns an instance of Status
- When using the Apache HTTP client the request output stream was not closed.
  This causes issues with using say the GZIP content encoding filter that
  requires the closing (or finishing) of the GZIP output stream
- Support a base path from which root resource classes are matchd when
  using the Grizzly adapter. The base path may be set as follows:

    ResourceConfig rc = ...
    Adapter a = ContainerFactory.createContainer(Adapter.class, rc);
    (GrizzlyAdapter)adapter).setResourcesContextPath("/basePath");

  By default the base path is "/".
- Integrated JSR 311 API 1.1
  - Require support for static fromString method in addition to existing valueOf
    method for types used as parameters in resource methods. For backwards
    compatibility, where both methods exist, valueOf will take precedence except
    for Enums where the precedence is reversed since every enum defines an
    implicit valueOf method that cannot be overridden.
  - Support Request.evaluatePreconditions() which is to be called when a
    resource does not exist. If the "If-Match" header is present with
    one or more entities, or is "*" then a 412 response will be returned
    otherwise null will be returned.
    This is primarily of use for implementations of PUT.
  - Unify the value of @Consumes and @Produces as follows:

        /**
         * A list of media types. Each entry may specify a single type or consist
         * of a comma separated list of types. E.g. {"image/jpeg,image/gif",
         * "image/png"}. Use of the comma-separated form allows definition of a
         * common string constant for use on multiple targets.
         */
        String[] value() default "*/*";
  - Add a secondary key to the sort order used when looking for compatible
    MessageBodyWriters such that writers whose declared generic type is closer
    in terms of inheritance are sorted earlier than those whose declared generic
    type is further.

release 1.0.3 (2009-04-15)

  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-163
  Guice integration is supported with the jersey-guice module.
- Fixed issue 245
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-245
  When the Apache Adbera Java types are utilized with the jersey-atom-abdera 
  module and the client API it is ensured that parsing of the types is completed
  before the type is returned to the user (because the input stream
  is closed before the type is returned to the user it is necessary to
  the complete parsing before the input stream is closed).
- Fixed issues 257 & 259
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-257
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-259
  added null value checks to UriBuilder.replaceQueryParam and
  UriTemplate.createURIComponent (used when building uri from a map)
- Resource filters can be utilized with implicit views. Annotations
  on the class will be utilized as annotations of the AbtractMethod, specifically
  the concrete class com.sun.jersey.api.model.AbstractImplicitViewMethod.
- Ensure that when @ImplicitProduces is utilized that the most acceptable
  media type is set as the content type when an implicit view is returned.
- Fixed issue 254
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-254
  Some implementations of javax.naming.InitialContext return null while

  Niall Gallagher contributed support for the Simple HTTP server
  integration with Jersey. See the JavaDoc for the following in the
  jersey-simple-server module:
    com.sun.jersey.simple.container.SimpleServerFactory
- Fixed issue 122
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-122
  When the ServletContainer is used as a filter then the init-param
  property "com.sun.jersey.config.property.WebPageContentRegex" may
  used to declare a regex to match against the request path. If the
  path matches then the requets is forwarded to the next filter (if any)
  in the filter chain and Jersey will not process the request.
  For example if you set the value to "/(image|css)/.*" then you can serve up
  images and CSS files for your Implicit or Explicit Views while still
  processing your JAX-RS resources.
- Added the annotation com.sun.jersey.multipart.FormDataParam for
  processing parameters that are named body parts of "multipart/form-data"
  messages. This functionality replaces the overloaded use of @FormParam,
  and such functionaity for processing "multipart/form-data" will be
  deprecated.
- Fixed issue 236
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-236
  Multiple named body parts of a "multipart/form-data" message can be accessed
  as follows:
    @Path("form-data")
    @Consumes(MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA)
    @POST
    public void uploadUrlFormData(
            @FormDataParam("file") List<FormDataBodyPart> parts) {
        for (FormDataBodyPart part : parts) {
            FormDataContentDisposition disp = part.
                    getFormDataContentDisposition();
            InputStream in = part.getValueAs(InputStream.class);
            ...
        }
    }
- Fixed issue 238
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-238
  The MIME multipart processing performed by the jersey-multipart module
  now utilizes the MIMEPull API, instance of the JavaMail API. MIMEPull
  enables streaming and caching, to disk, of body parts and does not
  require that a MIME multipart message be loaded completely into memory.
- Fixed issue 86
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-86
  The use of @FormParam with "multipart/form-data" will be deprecated
  and instead @FormDataParam, from the jersey-multipart module must be used.
  The behaviour of @FormDataParam is documented in the JavaDoc.

- Fixed issue 39
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-39
  Listening to and getting feedback from the client making requests and
  receiving responses is now possible using the filter:
    com.sun.jersey.api.client.filter.ConnectionListenerFilter
  Such a filter can be utilized to obtain progress for the sending
  and recieving of large documents.
- Fixed issue 181
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-181
  NotFoundException construction now includes an optional URI that was not
  found. Jersey will pass in the URI if it throws NotFoundException because
  the request URI could not be matched to a resource class.
- Fixed issue 198
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-198
  UriBuilder.uri works correctly replacing scheme specific parts.
- Fixed issue 240
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-240
  Fixed issue with LW HTTP server container not using the correct host and
  port for the base and request URIs. It is necessary to use the host and
  port declared in the Host HTTP header.
- Support for IoC integration where by the IoC framework manages components
  and supports third-party injection onto components by listening on
  post construction of a component.
  See:
    com.sun.jersey.core.spi.component.ioc.{
        IoCFullyManagedComponentProvider,
        IoCComponentProcessorFactory,
        IoCComponentProcessorFactoryInitializer
    }
- Fixed issue where charset of the media type was not being used when
  unmarshalling a list of JAXB objects serialized as a JSON document.
- Fixed issue 233
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-233
  The Jersey JSON parser now correctly supports lowercase unicode escape
  sequences.
- Fixed issue 221
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-226
  When resolving an absolute template name to a fully qualified template name
  that has a template processor associated with it, then the class hiararchy is
  trasversed such that if the absolute template name cannot be resolved from
  a declared resolving class, then resolution is attempted with the super class
  etc. until the Object class is reached, which if so means that resolution
  failed. This means views work correctly with cglib proxied resource classes.
- Fixed issue 226
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-226
  Viewable instances with absolute template names may be set as the response
  entity no matching resource available. Thus filters and exception mappers
  can use the model/view/control mechanism.
  In addition it is possible to declare the resolving class explicitly on
  a Viewable if required.
- Fixed issue 228
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-228
  Precondition support is now working correctly for If-None-Match and
  in combination with If-Unmodified-Since for GET, HEAD and other HTTP
  methods.
  In addition entity tag matching works correctly if there is more than one 
  entity tag to be matched in a If-Match and If-None-Match header, and entity
  tag matching works correctly using the weak and strong comparison functions
  as required.
- Fixed issue 224
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-224
  When a UniformInterfaceException is thrown by Async/WebResource then
  the response entity is buffered by default and resources are cleaned up.
  This ensures that the developer does not have to managed the cleaning up
  of resources. This behaviour may be overridden by setting the property
  ClientConfig.PROPERTY_BUFFER_RESPONSE_ENTITY_ON_EXCEPTION to false. If
  no buffering is configured then the devloper must explicitly close
  the ClientResponse instance obtained from the UniformInterfaceException.
- Added plugable Java type support for @*Param annotations.
  The provider interface, com.sun.jersey.spi.StringReaderProvider, may be
  implemented and registered as a provider. Parameter processing will defer
  to such providers for obtaining a StringReader capable of converting a String
  to an instance of the parameter annotated Java type.
  JAXB annotated classes and java.util.Date (using the standard HTTP date
  formats are supported.
- Fixed issue 213 and 214
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-213
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-214
  UriBuilder values check - hostname, port and queryParam values
- Fixed issue with servlet or filter initialization parameters not being
  copied to the ResourceConfig for Web applications that define and declare
  their own ResourceConfig implementation.
- Fixed two issues with the Apache HTTP client integration:
  1) Requests are repeatable by default and requests are buffered. Setting the
     property ClientConfig.PROPERTY_CHUNKED_ENCODING_SIZE to a value > 0 will
     turn off buffering.
  2) Connections are correctly released when a response entity is present
     but the client does not consume the entity. It is important if
     ClientResponse is used without reading an entity (when one is present) or
     entities are processed that are instances of Closeable that the response
     or stream is closed respectively after processing the response.
- The project version and build number are now correctly included in the
  jersey-bundle.jar and thus those values now appear correctly in generated
  WADL documents.

  property "com.sun.jersey.config.property.WebPageContentRegex" can be used
  to declare a regular expression. If that expression matches the servlet path
  then the request is forwarded to the next filter in the filter chain otherwise
  the ServletContainer processes the request.
  See:
    com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer#PROPERTY_WEB_PAGE_CONTENT_REGEX
  The bookstore sample has been modified to use this feature.
- Fixed problems with constructor injection for InjectableProvider providers.
  Application-defined injectable providers may now use the constructor for injection
  system-defined providers.
- Fixed issue where field injection occurs after a @PostConstruct method
  is invoked.
  Field injection is now performed after a component is instantiated and before
  the @PostConstruct method (if present) is invoked.
- Fixed issue 207
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-207
  The loading of resources uses the Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
  and loads resources using loader.getResourceAsStream().

release 1.0.2 (2009-02-11)
- JSON specific configuration options moved to a new JSONConfiguration class
  See JavaDoc for:
    com.sun.jersey.api.json.JSONConfiguration
- Added new NATURAL JSON notation
  Requires JAXB-RI impl 2.1.10
  When the new notation is used, users do not need any more 
  to take care about configurating proper serialization of arrays, numbers and booleans in JSON
- Fixed issue 180
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-180
  Support JSON with Padding.
  See JavaDoc for:
    com.sun.jersey.api.json.JSONWithPadding
- Support the setting of a javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext implementation
  on com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerRequest. This allows implementations,
  such as a request filter, to override the supply authorization logic in
  combination with the @RolesAllowed annotation and the
  com.sun.jersey.api.container.filter.RolesAllowedResourceFilterFactory.
- Fixed issue 160
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-160
  Added support for setting HTTPS properties (HostnameVerifier and SSLContext)
  when the Jersey Client with HttpsURLConnection. See JavaDoc of:
    com.sun.jersey.client.urlconnection.HTTPSProperties
- Added support when using the Jersey client for a factory to create
  HttpURLConnection or HttpsURLConnection. See JavaDoc of:
    com.sun.jersey.client.urlconnection.URLConnectionClientHandler

- Fixed issue 80
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-80
  The class and package registration mechanisms for root resource classes
  and providers works correctly on the JBoss 5.x app server.
- The ResourceDoclet (generating a resourcedoc file for extended WADL) moved
  from the maven-wadl-plugin to the wadl-resourcedoc-doclet module. If you're
  using extended wadl you need to change the docletArtifact/artifactId of the
  maven-javadoc-plugin configuration from maven-wadl-plugin to 
  wadl-resourcedoc-doclet.
- Include Jersey Client API with Apache HTTP client.
  Refer to the module:
        <groupId>com.sun.jersey.contribs</groupId>
        <artifactId>jersey-apache-client</artifactId>
- Fixed issue 177
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-177

  Query parameters may be built for a WebResource as follows:
    r.queryParam("a", "foo").queryParam("b", "bar").get(String.class)
- Fixed issue 196
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-196
  Removal of filters, using Filterable.removeFilter, no longer causes an
  exception.
- Fixed issue 196
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-196
  Conversion of an Object that is a header value will use the Object.toString()
  method if a header delegate cannot be found. For example,
     return Response.noContent().
                    header("X-INTEGER", 1).
                    build();
  will build a 204 response with a header "X-INTEGER: 1".
- jersey-archive module added to provide archive files that include the
  set of Jersey jars and JavaDoc. See:
  http://download.java.net/maven/2/com/sun/jersey/jersey-archive/
- Fixed issue 191
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-191
  ResourceConfig.isProviderClass and ResourceConfig.isRootResourceClass return
  false if the class parameter is null.
  This fixes an issue with the SpringComponentProviderFactory throwing an NPE
  for abstract Spring beans.
- Added support for a RenderedImage provider for consuming and producing images.
  For producing images the Java type must be assignable to RenderedImage. Any
  media type that is compatible with "image/*" is supported, but the actual
  image formats supported is restricted to the image readers registered with
  the Java imaging API.
  When consuming images the Java type RenderedImage or BufferedImage may be used.
  The media types supported for consuming are "image/*" and 
  "application/octet-stream". For the former the actual image formats supported
  is restricted to the image writers registered with the Java imaging API.
  For the latter the Java image API will determine the appropriate
  image format (if supported) from the contents of the entity body.
- Fixed issue 188
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-188
  Servlet consumes the request of the type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
  when HttpServletRequest.getParamter(...) and related methods are called.
  Jersey constructs a Form instance from the request parameters such that
  resource methods that utilize @FormParam will work as expected.
- Fixed issue 164
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-164
  Added ClientResponse.getResponseDate() to obtain the value of "Date" header.

  component was being ignored and the path component was used instead as
  the fragment component.
- Fixed issue 182
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-182
  The message of UniformInterfaceException is set to ClientResponse.toString()
  if no message is explicitly given. ClientResponse.toString() returns a String
  with the status code of the response.
- Fixed issue 150
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-150
  If no media type is declared with a client request of the Client API
  then an appropriate media type is derived from the Java type and the
  message body writers that support that Java type.
- Refactored Client API implementations for HttpURLConnection and the in-memory
  to leverage inherited classes for writing and reading HTTP requests and 
  responses. This makes it easier for other HTTP protocol implementations to 
  plugin and use the client API.
- Fixed issue 167
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-167
  A UniformInterfaceException will be thrown if the client requests an
  entity and the response status is 204.
- Fixed issue 170
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-170
  Encoding of ' ' in query parameters now round trips correctly.
     String encoded = UriComponent.encode(" ", Type.QUERY);
     assert(encoded.equals("%20"));
     String decoded = UriComponent.decode(encoded, Type.QUERY);
     assert(decoded.equals(" "));
  The encoding of ' ' to '+' now only occurs for Type.QUERY_PARAM.
     String encoded = UriComponent.encode(" ", Type.QUERY_PARAM);
     assert(encoded.equals("+"));
- Fixed issue 168
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-168

    MultivaluedMap<String, String> qps = new MultivaluedMapImpl();
    qps.add("a", "foo");
    qps.add("b", "bar");
    String s = r.queryParams(qps).get(String.class);
- For JAXB-related types the set of supported media types are "application/xml"
  "text/xml", "*/*+xml", "application/json", "*/*+json".
  Previously for JAXB-related types the set of media types for XML was
  unrestricted which limited the set of possible user-declared media types for
  JSON to just "application/json".
- Fixed issue 146
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-146
  UriBuilder.build was implemented as specified for UriBuilder.buildFromEncoded
  and vice versa, this has been corrected. The '&' character for the template 
  value of a template parameter that is part of a query parameter is now
  percent-encoded.
- Fixed issue 127
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-147
  WADL generation using incorrect class loader that fails when in an OSGi
  environment.
- Fixed issue for null Pathsegment that occurred for a sub-resource locator as
  follows:

  and uses @FormParam and receives content of the latter declared consuming
  media type for which some @FormParam parameters do not exist in the request.
- Fixed issue 147
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-147
  The base path in the Web Pages for JSP templates associated with viewables
  of resource classes is configurable. The base path may be declared as the
  value of the servlet init-param:
    "com.sun.jersey.config.property.JSPTemplatesBasePath"
- Refactored WADL generation classes to be placed in base package:
  com.sun.jersey.server.wadl. Previously WADL generation classes
  were in the base package com.sun.jersey.impl.wadl.
- Fixed issue 144
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-144
  Async/WebResource.toString returns a String instance of the URI of
  the Web resource.
- Fixed issue 123
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-123

  Improve error message when @Path value syntax is incorrect and is most likely
  because a path parameter is not terminated with a '}'.
- Enable the injection of of FormDataContentDispostion when using @FormParam
  in conjuction with "multipart/form-data". This enables access to parameters
  on the "form-data" content disposition header such as the value of the
  "filename" parameter.
- The following classes have been modified to include the creation of
  a container with an instance of an IoCContainerProviderFactory:
  - com.sun.jersey.api.container.ContainerFactory
  - com.sun.jersey.api.container.httpserver.HttpServerFactory
  - com.sun.jersey.api.container.grizzly.GrizzlyServerFactory
  A com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerProvider implementaton should not
  initiate the web application, otherwise the IoCContainerProviderFactory
  instance cannot be set.
- The following classes in jersey-core have moved:
  - The following classes in package "com.sun.jersey.api" have moved to
    the package "com.sun.jersey.core.header": InBoundHeaders, MediaTypes and
    OutBoundHeaders.
  - The following classe in package "com.sun.jersey.api" have moved to
    the package "com.sun.jersey.core.util": MultivaluedMapImpl.
- The Spring servlet automatically registers Spring-based classes (declared
  via the XML configuration or autowiring) and no configuration via the web.xml
  servlet initialization parameters is required unless non-Spring managed
  classes also need to be registered.
- Fixed issue 141
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-141

  used for the content type when the application declares @Produces on a class
  or a resource method.
- Fix for issue 138
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-138
  When the application does not declare a media type as the content type of
  a response then the type is selected from the acceptable headers given
  the list of message body writers, what they produce and an acceptable
  media type is writable.
- Fix for issue 139
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-139
  The media types in the accept header are ordered using the quality 
  parameter as the primiary key and the media specifity (x/y < x/* < */*)
  as the secondary key).
- When using JSP-based views the response status and meta-data is now committed
  to the HttpServletResponse before the JSP is processed.
- Fix for issue 137
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-137

  parameter this is likely, instead, to be associated with an request entity of 
  a resource method.
- Fixed issue 130
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-130
  Building from an @Path value that contains a template with a regex now
  build the URI without error.
- Fixed reloading of servlet container. The configuration of the web application
  occurs only at servlet initiation and not when a reload occurs.
- Included simple Groovy example.
- Fixed issue 128

  application and not by the Jersey runtime (which is an error, either in
  the runtime itself or in the configuration of the application).
- Fixed issue 124
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-124
  The method HttpRequestContext.getFormParameters can be used by a filter to
  obtain the form parameters.
  
release 1.0 (2008-10-13)
- The response filter chain will now get invoked if an exception is thrown
  from a request filter or a resource class and is mapped to a response.
  If an exception is thrown from a response filter then the response filter
  chain is terminated and the exception is mapped to a response.
- Fixed issue 119
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-119
  Locale instances not correctly created from HTTP language-based headers.
- Fixed issue with bridge methods being included in the analysis

  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-114
  When URI building with template parameters and no explicit port is declared
  then -1 occurs as the port component in the built URI.
- Support for EJB stateless session beans as resource classes.
  A local or remote interface may be annotated with JAX-RS annotations, for
  example the interface may be annotated with @Path to make the session bean
  a root resource class.
  When an application is deployed Jersey will attempt to look up any registeted
  root resource classes that are interfaces using JNDI where the fully qualified
  class name is the JNDI name. If an instance is found then the class is removed
  from registered set of classes and the instance is added to the registered set
  of singletons.

  ClassLoader.
- Fixed issue 110
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-110
  "If none of the entity tags match, then the server MAY perform the requested
   method as if the If-None-Match header field did not exist, but MUST also
   ignore any If-Modified-Since header field(s) in the request. That is, if no
   entity tags match, then the server MUST NOT return a 304 (Not Modified)
   response."
- Fixed issue 103

  Improved error message when an invalid media type is declared for the content
  type of an HTTP request when using the client API. The exception produced 
  occurs closer to the source of the error.
- Catch a java.lang.ClassFormatError when loading providers. This can occur
  if a 'stubbed' jar is in the class path that contains classes with no
  implementation.
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.11
  - Query/Matrix parameter names used as keys in returned
    MultivaluedMap<String, String> from UriInfo method calls are always in
    decoded form.
  - MessageBodyWriter.isWriterable/getSize and MessageBodyWriter.isReadable
    method signatures now have additional parameters contain the type, generic
    type, annotations and media type.

release 0.10-SNAPSHOT
- Per-session life-cycle is supported for Servlet-based Web applications.
  See com.sun.jersey.spi.container.servlet.PerSession
- Access to query parameters, path segments and matrix parameters is now
  possible from com.sun.jersey.api.core.HttpRequestContext
- Fixed issue with resource methods utilizing @FormParam that could only
  contain @FormParam annotated method parameters. Now @FormParam annotated
  parameters may be intermixed with other annotated parameters.
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.10
  - java.ws.rs.core.ApplicationConfig renamed to java.ws.rs.core.Application
  - ApplicationConfig.getResourceClasses() and
    ApplicationConfig.getProviderClasses() merged into one method
    Application.getClasses()
  - Application.getSingletons() can be used to add singleton provider
    instances or root resource class instances.
  - URI templates declared in @Path now support general regular expressions.
    A regular expression may be declared by declaring the template variable
    followed by a ':' followed by the regular expression. For example, the
    URI template "{n: .+}" declares there to be one template variable 'n' whose
    regular expression is ".+". In the absense of a declared regular expression
    the default expression "[^/]+?" applies. White space may occur between the
    '{' and the template variable name, between the template variable name
    and the ':', between the ':' and the regular expression, and finally
    between the regular expression and the '}'. Non-compliant characters for
    a URI path must be percent-encoded.
  - @Path "limited" and "encode" properties have been removed.
    The @Path(value="{a}", limited=false) is equivalent to
    @Path("{a: .*}") or @Path("{a: .+}")
  - javax.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder.encode has been removed. Instead contextual
    encoding is performed automatically. Any non-compliant character is
    percent-encoded but existing percent-encoded character (namely a '%' followed
    by two hexadecimal characters) is left unmodified (thus the '%' character
    is not percent-encoded itself).

release 0.9 (2008-08-22)
- Fixed issue 93
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-93
  always write JSON using a JSON library for examples
- Fixed issue 50

  Jersey version is included in the WADL as the first doc element.
- Fixed issue 97
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-96
  Methods on JAX-RS conforming annotated interfaces (if present) are used 
  for invocation as opposed to the concrete methods on the concrete class.
  This allows for the possibility to proxy an instance using the interface.
- SpringServlet no longer overrides Servlet.service, which previously 
  caught all RuntimeException and did not re-throw them.
- Fixed issue 96
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-96

  A message body writer may modify the http headers before any bytes
  are written to the output stream.
- JAXB un/marshalling will use any ContextResolver<Un/Marshaller>
  instances, if present, otherwise, if not present un/marshalling will use
  ContextResolver<JAXBContext>, if present. The @Produces scope will be
  taken into account.
- Set the Content-Length, if known, in automatic response to a HEAD request 
  that defers to the @GET annotated resource method.
- Fixed issue where a message body reader is not correctly selected for 
  a media type that contains parameters.
- Server-side request filter for HTTP POST method replacing for proxies and
  servers that block methods other than GET/POST.
  See JavaDoc of:
  com.sun.jersey.api.container.filter.PostReplaceFilter
- Support server side request/response filters
  See JavaDoc of:
  com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerRequestFilter
  com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerResponseFilter
  ResourceConfig.PROPERTY_CONTAINER_REQUEST_FILTERS
  ResourceConfig.PROPERTY_CONTAINER_RESPONSE_FILTERS
- Select the constructor for a resource classe that has the most parameters
  that has the most instances are available for those parameters.
- Support constructors with parameters on singleton resource classes.
- Fixed issue 79
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-79
  ';' separated package names and classpaths specified in the web.xml are
  trimmed.
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.9
  - Information in a returned Response is not modified and the media type
    (if set) will override that declared in @Produces.
  - Path parameters match 1 or more characters that are not '/' 
    (previously it was zero or more of any character), unless the final 
     parameter is unlimited, in which case it is the same as before.
  - Path parameter names are matching with the following regex:
      "\{([\w[-\w\.]*)\}"
  - com.sun.jersey.api.representation.FormParam has been deleted. Use
    javax.ws.rs.FormParam instead.
  - javax.ws.rs.ConsumeMime and javax.ws.rs.ProduceMime have been renamed
    to javax.ws.rs.Consumes and javax.ws.rs.Produces respectively.
  - Resource methods may return generic types, such as List<String>, and
    an appropriate MessageBodyWriter, for that generic type may be selected.
    - When using Response.Builder an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.GenericEntity
      may be set as the entity to preserve the generic type.
  - ContextResolver can be scoped per @Produces annotated on a
    implementation.
    - Scope ContextResolver instances are accessible via the 
      javax.ws.rs.ext.Providers interface.

release 0.8 (2008-06-20)
- UriBuilder supports opaque URIs such as "mailto:p@c".
- Support the reading of an entity delcared as the type Object using JAXB
  unmarshalling. It is required that there be a ContextResolver<JAXBContext>
  that supports a JAXBContext for the Object type.
- The following properties can be set on the client:
    Read timeout, connection timeout, chunked encoding length and 
    following redirections.
  See setter methods on com.sun.jersey.api.client.ClientConfig and
  properties on com.sun.jersey.api.client.config.ClientConfig.
- Simplified web.xml configuration when using package scanning for root
  resource classes. For package scanning the web.xml need only contain the 
  following:

        <init-param>
            <param-name>com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages</param-name>
            <param-value>*list of ';' separated package names*</param-value>
        </init-param>

  previously it was necessary to declare another <init-param> referencing the
  the PackageResourceConfig class.  
- The container SPI is improved and simplified, see JavaDoc of:
    com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerRequest
    com.sun.jersey.spi.container.InBoundHeaders
    com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerResponse
    com.sun.jersey.spi.container.ContainerWriter

    ClientConfig.getProviderInstances().add()
- Removed WebApplication.addInjectable, use the following instead:
    ResourceConfig.getProviderInstances().add()
- Instances of provider classes can be declared by the application by adding
  provider instances to the Set returned by the method:
    ResourceConfig.getProviderInstances()
- Modified com.sun.jersey.spi.container.{AbstractContainerRequest, 
  AbstractContainerResponse} to take WebApplication as an input parameter
  as opposed to previously taking MessageBodyContext.
- Removed com.sun.jersey.spi.container.MessageBodyContext, this is replaced
  by javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyWorkers.
- com.sun.jersey.api.uri.ExtendedUriInfo can be injected.
- The annotation com.sun.jersey.api.representation.FormParam can be used
  to access form-based parameters using the same rules as other parameter-based
  annotatons.
  Form-based resource methods MUST contain only annotated method parameters
  and at least one parameter MUST be annotated with FormParam.
  This works for the two media types "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and
  "multipart/form-data". For the latter this will only work if the a resource 
  declares that it consumes "multipart/form-data" using @ConsumeMime. In this
  case message body readers will be used to obtain the instances of the
  @FormParam annotated parameters, as opposed to applying the rules for other
  @*Param annotated parameters.
- Renamed com.sun.jersey.spi.service.Component.Scope enums from->to:
  WebApplication -> Singleton; and ApplicationDefined -> PerRequest
- Unified injection interfaces so that they are independent of where 
  injection occurs. See the package com.sun.jersey.spi.inject.
  - com.sun.jersey.spi.resource.Inject moved to com.sun.jersey.spi.inject.Inject
  - the com.sun.jersey.spi.inject.InjectableProvider behaves as a provider 
    class and may be annotated with @Provider.   
- Simple asynchronous client API returning Future<T>. Current implementation
  utilizes one thread per-request.
- Moved com.sun.ws.rest.impl.json.JSONJAXBContext to
  com.sun.jersey.api.json.JSONJAXBContext.
- Removed JAX-WS container.
- Set<T> and SortedSet<T> can be used in addition to List<T> for the type of
  @*Param annotation parameters.
- Packages "com.sun.ws.rest.api.*" renamed to "com.sun.jersey.api.*"
- Packages "com.sun.ws.rest.spi.*" renamed to "com.sun.jersey.spi.*"
- The property/feature name space "com.sun.ws.rest.config" renamed to 
  "com.sun.jersey.config".
- The type javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement<T> can be used for XML and JSON
  serialization.
- Partially Integrated JSR 311 API 0.8
  - MediaType.parse renamed to MediaType.valueOf
  - NewCookie.parse renamed to NewCookie.valueOf
  - Cookie.parse renamed to Cookie.valueOf
  - CacheControl.parse renamed to CacheControl.valueOf
  - EntityTag.parse renamed to EntityTag.valueOf
  - UriInfo.getTemplateParameters renamed to UriInfo.getPathParameters
  - ApplicationConfig.getExtensibleMapping renamed to 
    ApplicationConfig.getMediaTypeMappings
  - Method parameter order of MessageBodyReader.readFrom has changed to be
    consistent with the method parameter order of MessageBodyWriter.writerTo.
  - javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper<T> may be used to map a runtime or 
    checked exception to a javax.ws.rs.core.Response instance.

release 0.7 (2008-04-18)
- The type javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement<T> can be used for reading and writing
  JAXB types that a not XML root elements from and to XML. TODO:JSON
  serialization.
- Renamed FormURLEncodedProperties to Form and changed the class to implement 
  javax.ws.rs.core.MultivaluedMap.
- Containers can be informed when they are required to reload, for example
  if new root resource classes have been added to removed, or class file
  definitions have changed while a VM is running.
  A com.sun.ws.rest.spi.container.ContainerNotifier instance may be 
  registered by adding a property to the ResourceConfig with the property name
  "com.sun.ws.rest.spi.container.ContainerNotifier" and a property value
  that is the instance of the ContainerNotifier.
  The ContainerNotifier instance may then notifier registered listeners
  when reloading is required.
- The com.sun.ws.rest.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer class has
  a public load() method that can be invoked to dynamically reload the web
  web application if, for example, resource classes have been modified,
  added or removed.
- The class com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.ApplicationConfigAdapter can be
  used to adapt an instance of javax.ws.rs.core.ApplicationConfig to an
  instance of com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.ResourceConfig.
- Client API request building supports the addition of cookies that are 
  instances of javax.ws.rs.core.Cookie. Client API response supports obtaining
  the list of cookies returned by the server as instances of 
  javax.ws.rs.NewCookie.
- Renamed HttpContextAccess to HttpContext. Changed getHttpRequestContext
  and getHttpResponseContext methods to getRequest and getResponse respectively.
- UriRuleContext extends HttpContext. Removed UriRuleContext.getHttpContext()
  method.
- UriInfo interface is removed from HttpRequestContext. UriInfo is now
  accessible from HttpContext.getUriInfo()
- Fixed issue 44: Support dependency injection of proxied resources
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-44
  Added method ComponentProvider.getInjectableInstance
- The AbstractContainerResponse.writeEntity methods are reduced to one
  method that takes no arguments. This is responsible for committing the
  status, headers and writing out the entity (if any), and returning a 406
  (Not Acceptable) if a message body reader could not be found to serialize
  the entity for the required media type.
- The AbstractContainerResponse.commitStatusAndHeaders was modified to take
  a parameter that is the known length in bytes of the entity to be written
  as the representation of a response.
- Partially Integrated JSR 311 API 0.7
  - Use @Context to inject HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, 
    ServletConfig and ServletContext instances on JAX-RS/Jersey-based 
    components deployed in Servlet container.
  - UriBuilder.build(String... values) changed to 
    UriBuilder.build(Object... values). 
    UriBuilder.build(Map<String, String> values) changed to 
    UriBuilder.build(Map<String, Object> values).
    The Object instances must support the toString method.
  - Message body writer for javax.ws.rs.core.StreamingOutput.
  - Message body reader/writer for java.io.Reader.
  - Message body reader/writer for javax.xml.transform.Source
    Only the following Java types are supported for reading:
      - javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamSource
      - javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource
      - javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource
  - Message body reader/writer MultivaluedMap<String, String>
    with the media type "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".
  - Injection of javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyWorkers to get message body
    readers and writers. Note this is very similar to
    com.sun.ws.rest.spi.container.MessageBodyContext, which will be removed
    if/when MessageBodyWorkers supports the same functionality.
  - javax.ws.rs.ext.ContextResolver replaces
    com.sun.ws.rest.spi.service.ContextResolver (which has been removed).
  - javax.ws.rs.core.ApplicationConfig is the abstract base class of
    com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.ResourceConfig.
    ResourceConfig has changed from an interface to an abstract class.
  - Media type charset parameter is recognized for reading/writing
    Java types for text-based content. Default charset is UTF-8 if charset 
    parameter is absent.
  - If a message body reader cannot be found return 415 (Unsupported Media Type)
  - if a message body writer cannot be found return 406 (Not Acceptable)
  - The list of ancestor resource classes and URI paths are available
    via UriInfo.getAncestorResources() and UriInfo.getAncestorResourceURIs()
    respectively. Such information can be used for "breadcrumb" support or
    aiding construction of URIs that are hyperlinks in representations.
  - Parameters can be annotated with @CookieParam for the type 
    javax.ws.rs.core.Cookie and types conforming to the standard rules.
  - RuntimeDelegate.getInstance().createEndpoint() can be used to create
    a container artifact. This is an alternative to the Jersey specific 
    ContainerFactory.createContainer().
  - The web.xml may specify the javax.ws.rs.core.ApplicationConfig class using 
    the init-param name "javax.ws.rs.ApplicationConfig" with a value that is 
    the class name of a class that extends (directly or indirectly) 
    ApplicationConfig.
    Note that the existing Jersey mechanism using ResourceConfig will take
    precendence if both ApplicationConfig and ResourceConfig classes names are
    declared as init-params.
  - Concrete methods implementing methods on interfaces or overriding methods on
    super classes (abstract or otherwise) may inherit JAX-RS annotations on such
    inheriting methods if and only if there are no JAX-RS annotations on the 
    concrete method or it's parameters.
  - Generic types, such as List<String>, can be processed by MessageBodyReaders.
  - javax.ws.rs.core.PathSegment may be used with @Path. The last most path
    segment containing the declared path parameter will be obtiained. 

release 0.6.2 (2008-03-27)
- Fixed issue 52: xml attrs in JSON representation deserialization
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-52

release 0.6.1 (2008-03-18)
- Support for xml attributes serialization/deserialization in JSON added
  (as a fix for 43)
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-43
- Fixed issue 45: Jersey leaves stream open; locks JAR file on Windows
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-45

release 0.6 (2008-03-07)
- Support for a Model View Controller abstraction and plugging in templates
  processors that process models that produce views. See classes in the package:
    com.sun.ws.rest.spi.template
- Consumable and configuration JSON support with JAXB
- Grizzly support is upgraded to 1.7.2.
- A sub-resource locator can now return a Class instance, that will be
  instantiated using a ComponentProvider, using the life-cycle rules for
  resource classes.
- Removed support for using the GET to return WADL of resources, only the
  OPTIONS method is supported. The application.wadl is still obtained using GET.
- Fixed issue 41: WebApplicationException(500) returning response code 2
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-41
- The default values for the following resource configuration features are
  now false: URI normalization, URI path canonicalization and URI redirection.
  This means by default no automatic redirection will be performed.
- The resource configuration feature FEATURE_IGNORE_MATRIX_PARAMS is
  renamed to FEATURE_MATCH_MATRIX_PARAMS and the default value is now false.
- Fixed issue 35: Cryptic error message for invalid media type of response
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-35
- When utilizing the ClasspathResourceConfig include files ending
  in .zip and treat them as jar files.
- Fixed NPE for PackagesResourceConfig when scanning directories that
  contain characters such as space (that are percent-encoded in URLs).
- Unified component instantation and injection. 
  Included an SPI for plugging in IoC frameworks.
  Life-cycle of resource classes is now independent of the IoC framework.
  Many Jersey components may now particpate in an IoC 'session'.
- MessageBodyReader and MessageBodyWriter implementations are searched for
  dynamically using the same class scanning techniques as for resource classes.
- User-defined JAXB contexts may be specified using an implementation of
  ContextResolver<JAXBContext> that is annotated with @Provider.
- Included Client API that focuses on the uniform interface, see classes in 
  package:
    com.sun.ws.rest.api.client  
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.6
  - java.ws.rs.ext.ProviderFactory replaced with java.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate.
  - java.ws.rs.ext.HeaderProvider is removed. This is replaced with
    java.ws.rs.ext.RuntimeDelegate.HeaderDelegate.
  - java.ws.rs.UriParam renamed to java.ws.rs.PathParam
  - java.ws.rs.core.HttpContext renamed to java.ws.rs.Context
  - javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Builder renamed to 
    javax.ws.rs.core.Response.ResponseBuilder
  - The charset parameter is removed from javax.ws.rs.core.Variant
    constructor and getters. The method to add one or more charsets has been
    removed from javax.ws.rs.core.Variant.VariantListBuilder. The charset
    parameter must be included as a "charset" parameter of the media type.
  - Response.ResponseBuilder.tag(String ) now assumes the String parameter
    value is the contents of a strong entity tag rather than the entity tag
    itself.
  - javax.ws.rs.core.Response.ResponseBuilder.cookie now takes an array of 
    javax.ws.rs.core.NewCookie.
  - javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders.getCookies now returns a type of 
    Map<String, Cookie>, instead of a type List<Cookie>, where the key
    is the name of the cookie.
  - The return type of the javax.ws.rs.core.Request.evaluatePreconditions 
    methods has changed from javax.ws.rs.core.Response to 
    javax.ws.rs.core.Response.ResponseBuilder.

release 0.5 (2008-01-18)
- WADL ant task for generating a WADL document of the root resources present
  in a given classpath. See the class:
    com.sun.ws.rest.api.wadl.WadlGeneratorTask
- WADL is now generated at runtime (rather then compile time). WADL is generated
  as before for the application but in addition it is not possible to get WADL 
  for a resource by the client sending a GET request that accepts 
  "application/vnd.sun.wadl+xml", if the application does not override 
  support for this media type or supports a more general type, or using the 
  OPTIONS method.
- Support injection of the ServletContext on a resource class when
  using the servlet container.
- Updated Mandel example to use Scala 2.6.1.
- Updated NetBeans project files of Jersey and the examples to version 6.0
- Fixed bug for HTTP methods on a super class that have an entity parameter 
  that is a (generic) type variable.
- Fixed bug for injecting onto fields of a super class
- Fixed issue 25: UriBuilder uri() not concatinating properly
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-25
- Grizzly support is upgraded to 1.7.0.
- Grizzly and the LW HTTP server now have easy ways to start a server
  deployed with root resource classes, see: 
  - com.sun.ws.rest.api.container.grizzly.GrizzlyServerFactory
  - com.sun.ws.rest.api.container.httpserver.HttpServerFactory
- Fixed issue 1: Matching errors for sub-resource methods with equivalent URI 
  template regexs but different template variables
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-1
  Different sub-resource locator and HTTP methods may have different
  URI templates that differ only by template variable name.
- Removed the com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.WebResource interface and resource class
  support for this interface.
- Root resource classes, by default, are now found at runtime (rather than
  compile time) by efficiently scanning the Java class files of the 
  java.class.path for SE-based deployments or the WEB-INF/lib and 
  WEB-INF/classes for Servlet-based deployments. Alternatively it is optionally
  possibly to scan the Java classes files using a list of package names.
  See the JavaDoc of the following classes for more details:
    - com.sun.ws.rest.api.container.ContainerFactory
    - com.sun.ws.rest.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer
    - com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.ClasspathResourceConfig
    - com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.PackagesResourceConfig
- JAXB XML and JSON support now split into separate implementations,
  and the former no longer requires the jars of the latter in the classpath.
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.5
  - EntityProvider is split into two separate interfaces
    MessageBodyReader and MessageBodyWriter
  - java.ws.rs.UriTemplate renamed to java.ws.rs.Path
  - javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo has the following changes:
    - renamed method getBase to getBaseUri
    - renamed method getBaseBuilder to getBaseUriBuilder
    - renamed method getAbsolute to getAbsolutePath
    - renamed method getBuilder to getAbsolutePathBuilder
    - add methods getRequestUri and getRequestUriBuilder
  - Refactored @HttpMethod:
    - @HttpMethod is now a meta-annotation
    - Specific annotations @HEAD, @GET, @PUT, @DELETE and @POST replace 
      @HttpMethod("<method") and @HttpMethod with the HTTP method derived 
      from the Java method name.
  - javax.ws.rs.core.Response has the following changes:
    - Changed from interface to abstract class
    - Static methods on Response.Builder moved to Response 
      (and in some cases renamed).
    - Changed method "addMetaData(MultivaluedMap)" to 
      "MultivaluedMap getMetaData()"
  - HTTP header related classes have the following changes:
    - Where appropriate such classes have a static parse method
      to create an instance from a String representation, for example
      MediaType m = MediaType.parse("text/plain") instead of a constructor.
    - All classes override toString for serialization
    - javax.ws.rs.core.Cookie is changed to an immutable class
    - javax.ws.rs.core.NewCookie is changed to an immutable class

release 0.4 (2007-11-02)
- Fixed issue 17: Matrix Parameter With URL Value Ends Up With 404
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-17
  A specific JVM option parameter is required to be set when using
  Glassfish (see issue for details).
- Added matrix and header param support to WADL
- Fixed issue 19: java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException for 
  LW HTTP container
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-19
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.4.
- The runtime no longer logs the stack trace for a caught 
  WebApplicationException with a status code < 500. 
- Fixed bug in File entity provider, the FileInput/OutputStream is
  wrapped around a BufferedInput/OutputStream.
- Fixed bug in InputStream and DataStource entity providers, after the bytes 
  read from the InputStream have been written the InputStream is closed.
- Added new example, Mandel, for accessing Mandelbrots as a web service.
  The example is written in Scala and uses Scala actors.
- Support the @Encoded on class, constructors, method and method parameters.
  https://jsr311.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/javax/ws/rs/Encoded.html
  Advanced developers may work in the encoded space of URI parameters,
  query parameters and matrix parameters by declaring this annotation on
  a class, method or method parameter.
- Updated URI template ordering to conform to latest changes in JAX-RS:
  "Sort the set of matching resource classes using the number of 
   characters in the regular expression not resulting from template 
   variables as the primary key and the number of matching groups 
   as a secondary key"
  This means that a URI template such as "/edit" will take precedence over 
  a URI template such as /{id}, where as previously this was not the case.
- Fixed issue 13: Create AbstractServletAdapter class that allows modification 
  of its WebApplication
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-13
  The servlet implementation has been split into two. The servlet,
  com.sun.ws.rest.spi.container.servlet.ServletContainer may be used
  directly or extended for additional configuration requirements.

release 0.3 (2007-09-21)
- ResourceConfig interface is modified to support a feature bag and property
  bag with documented standard features.
  DefaultResourceConfig is mutable implementation of ResourceConfig.
  The APT tool generates ResourceConfig classes that inherit from 
  DefaultResourceConfig.
- Created SPI container helper classes AbstractContainerRequest and
  AbstractContainerResponse.
  This makes it easier for developers to write and maintain their own
  containers. Previously it was necessary to implement the interfaces
  ContainerRequest and ContainerResponse or depend on the implementation 
  specific classes HttpRequestContextImpl and HttpResponseContextImpl.
- Fixed issue 8: apt tool silently overwrites existing web.xml by default
  The "noservlet" option used with the WebResourcesProcessorTask ant task
  has been removed so that by default Servlet is not assumed no overriding 
  of a web.xml occurs. A new option "servlet" replaces the old option and is 
  required to be set for the ant task (and apt tool) to generate a web.xml.
- Fixed issue 2: URI path matching should operate on the encoded path
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-2
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.3.
  The class javax.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder is implemented. This is the preferred
  way to create URIs.
  Method names on javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo were modified, the string "URI"
  or "Uri" was removed.
  The methods javax.ws.rs.ext.EntityProvider#readFrom/writeTo take
  a MediaType as a paramater, which corresponds to the "Content-Type"
  HTTP header field.
- Correctly support the writing of responses for the method signature:
    void <method>(HttpRequestContext, HttpResponseContext)
  this includes the method signature for resources that implement the interface
  com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.WebResource.
  An entity may be directly written by the application by obtaining an 
  OutputStream from the HttpResponseContext.getOutputStream() method.
- New SPI com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resource.* replaces com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resolver.*
  Supports addition of new resource providers that are responsible for creating 
  resource class instances and managing their lifecycle. The provider for a 
  particular resource class is set via the ResourceFactory meta-annotation, 
  see com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resource.Singleton for an example of its usage. 
  Default lifecycle for resource class instances is per-request, the prior 
  behaviour can be obtained by annotating a resource class with 
  com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resource.Singleton. Resource class constructors with a 
  per-request lifecycle can now have the same parameters as methods annotated 
  with HttpMethod.

release 0.2.1 (2007-09-04)
- Fixed issue 4: Unsed jars required to be included in the class path for use 
  of certain entity providers
  http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY-4
- JsonFromJaxb example added to demonstrate using JSON representation 
  of JAXB based resources
- 'jersey-on-glassfish.xml' ant script added to distribution
  so that users can install jersey jars, docs and examples on GlassFish
- Simpler getting started document included.
- Fixed bug that caused matrix parameters to be decoded twice.
- JAXB beans can be serialized as JSON or XML using one HTTP method with
  a @ProduceMime({"application/xml", "application/json"}).
- For an HTTP method that produces more than one media type automatically
  select the appropriate media type according to what is acceptable. This
  enables a developer to implement one method for the returning of a JAXB 
  bean that can be serialized as XML or JSON.
- Rename the zip of the Jersey respository from 'jersey-src' to 
  'jersey-snapshot'.
- Include zip of 311 src and Jersey src in the lib directory of the 
  distribution to faciliate easier debugging.
- Fixed bug in light weight HTTP server container that caused query parameters
  to be decoded twice and incorrectly extracted from the URI query string.
- JSON entity providers added to support JSONArray and JSONObject 
  entities from Jettison.

release 0.2 (2007-07-19)
- include Allow header in a 405 (Method Not Allowed) response.
- support by default OPTIONS request if OPTIONS is not implemented.
- support by default HEAD request if HEAD is not implemented by calling GET 
  and removing the entity.
- fixed WADL generation mixing up produce/consume information when generating
  responses.
- fixed WADL generation not correctly determining the HTTP method from 
  @HttpMethod Java method name.
- WebApplication.initiate can only be called once. Throw exception on subsequent
  calls.
- Removed implementation of @SubResources, equivalent functionality supported 
  by sub-resource locator methods.
- Removed implementation of @UnmatchedPath, equivalent functionality supported 
  by greedy parameter on @UriTemplate.
- JSON support added to JAXB entity provider for use with "application/json",
  media type. BadgerFish convention is used. Runtime dependency on jettison jar.
- Views refactored to work correctly in combination with HTTP methods
- removed the @SubResource annotation from the examples
- removed Entity class, equivalent functionality is supported by the 
  javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders class
- Bookmark example added
- include 311 API distribution, src and javadoc
- fixed the formatting of java.util.Date for HTTP-date to conform to RFC 1123
- refactored API/SPI messages
- include jersey API/SPI javadoc
- URIs and URI templates with escaped space character throw exception for 
  URI.create, found by Julian Reschke:
  https://jersey.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=1 
- include version information in manifest of jersey.jar

release 0.1 (2007-06-19)
- initial stable snapshot
