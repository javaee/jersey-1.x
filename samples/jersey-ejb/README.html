        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p style="color: red">This sample utilizes features of the GlassFish
            EJB 3.1 container only available in Glassfish v3 build 58
            and later versions. This sample will not work with Glassfish v3
            Prelude or Preview.</p>

        <p>If you are working with Jersey GlassFish update center module installed into your existing GlassFish
            instance,
            you will need to follow instructions at <a href="../../README.html">the module README file</a> in order to
            deploy the example.

        <p>Otherwise, you can run the example using embedded GlassFish as follows:</p>

        <p>Build and deploy the project by executing maven 2 from the project directory</p>
        <blockquote><code>mvn clean package embedded-glassfish:run</code></blockquote>

        <p>From a web browser, visit:</p>
