  <body>
	<h1>AtomPub Example Application -- Contacts System</h1>
	      
	      <p>This module is one of a three part set of modules that contain an example
application using the jersey-atom-abdera module to send and receive data
encapsulated in Atom Publishing Protocol feeds and entries.  The sample
application itself is inspired by the Google Contacts Data API
<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/">http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/</a>, with some additional functionality
to illustrate alternative techniques.
</p>
	      
	      <h2>Introduction</h2>
	      <p>The separation of functionality into three modules allows a common set of
JavaBean "model" classes to be shared by the client and server modules.
</p>

    	<h3>atompub-contacts-models module</h3>
    	    <p>
    	    This module contains JavaBean classes for the two types of application data
	    that can be transmitted via this web service -- User represents a system user,
	    and Contact represents one of potentially many contacts associated with that
	    user.  The User class contains JAXB annotations, so we can leverage the fact
	    that JAX-RS based applications can automatically serialize and deserialize
	    instances of such a class, with no need to provide MessageBodyReader or
	    MessageBodyWriter providers itself.
    	     </p>

        <h3>atompub-contacts-server module</h3>
	    	    <p>
	    	    This module contains a Jersey based server that implements the contacts API.
		    To simplify setup, the "database" behind this service is hashmaps of
		    JavaBeans (so it goes away when the service is stopped).  It implements two
		    top-level resources -- "/users" returns an Atom feed of all users defined
		    in the database, while "/contacts/{username}" returns an Atom feed of all
		    contacts defined for the specified user.
	    	     </p>
	    	     <p>
	    	     The server implementation uses a Jersey filter to implement authentication
		     and authorization checks.  Every client request must specify a valid username/
		     password combination (<b>the database is initialized with a user named
             "admin" and password "password"</b>).  The administrative user can add, update,
		     and delete other users, as well as manage the contacts for any user.  All
		     other users can only manage their own contact lists.
		     </p>    	    	    
	    	     <p>
	    	     The server illustrates two different techniques for embedding application
		     data in Atom feeds and entries:
	    	     	<ul>
	    	     		<li>
					Contact data is sent and received by using a custom XML namespace,
  and embedding the various data elements as extension elements in an
  Atom entry.  This is the same technique that Google Contacts Data API
  uses for this purpose.	    	     		
	    	     		</li>
	    	     		<li>
					User data is sent and received by embedding a custom XML representation
  inside the &lt;content&gt; element of an Atom entry.  The ContentHelper
  class (from jersey-atom-abdera) is utilized to serialize and deserialize
  the User instances, using the same providers (built in, since this class
  has JAXB annotations) that would be used if you sent or received the
  User instance as an entity of a JAX-RS request or response.	    	     			
	    	     		</li>
	    	     	</ul>
	    	     </p>
	    	     <p>
	    	     		This module has a dependency on the "atompub-contacts-models" module for
				definitions of the Contact and User classes representing the application data
				that can be transported.
	    	     </p>
            <h3>atompub-contacts-client module</h3>
    		<p>
    		While you can write a client application to communicate with this server in
		any language you like (including Java), a Java client application has the
		option to use the ContactsClient class from this module as a proxy for the
		remote web service.  This allows your application development efforts to
		focus on the business logic of your application, rather than the low level
		details of formatting a proper Atom message, and dealing with low level
		HTTP communication.
		</p>
        <p>
		This module also has a dependency on the "atompub-contacts-models" module
		for definitions of the Contact and User classes (same dependency as the
		server, so that these classes are guaranteed to be defined identically
		at both ends).
      </p>


    <h3>Running the example</h3>
    <p>You can start the server by issuing
   <pre>
       mvn clean compile exec:java
    </pre>
    from <code>atompub-contacts-server</code> directory.

    Then at <a href="http://localhost:9998/users">http://localhost:9998/users</a> you can see an initial list of users
    as an Atom feed, after you have logged in entering a user name of "admin" and a password of "password" in the dialog box.

    <p>Then you can try to the client with
    <pre>
        cd ../atompub-contacts-client
        mvn clean compile exec:java
    </pre>

    The client should populate data on a new user. You can now check <a href="http://localhost:9998/users">http://localhost:9998/users</a>
    again to see the new user.
