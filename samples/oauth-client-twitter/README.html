        <h1>OAuth Client Sample - Twitter Client</h1>

        <p>
            This example demonstrates how to develop a simple web app client
            utilizing Jersey client API and Jersey OAuth support.
        </p>

        <h2>Contents</h2>
        <p>
            This example consists of the main class (<code>App</code>) and two JAXB beans
            used for unmarshaling the responses from Twitter (<code>Status</code> and <code>User</code>).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Running the Example</h2>
        <h3>Registering with Twitter</h3>
        <p>
            Before running the example, you have to register your own application
            with Twitter (to obtain consumer key and consumer secret you have to use
            to configure this client). You can do it as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter Developers Page</a> and click <b>Register an app</b> link.</li>
            <li>Fill out the registration form - you have to pick a unique application name (e.g. app12345678), put in
                some description, put in something for app website (e.g. http://jersey.java.net),
                select <b>Client</b> as the Application Type, enter captcha.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Register application</b> button.</li>
            <li>Accept terms</li>
            <li>You will be presented with consumer key, consumer secret and other details for your registered application.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Running for the First Time</h3>
        <p>Enter the following on the command-line:</p>
        <pre>
        mvn clean compile java:exec -DconsumerKey=&lt;consumer key assigned to your app&gt; -DconsumerSecret=&lt;consumer secret assigned to your app&gt;
        </pre>
        <h3>Subsequent Runs</h3>
        <p>After you run the application for the first time, it stores the consumer key, secret and token and token secret
        in a property file for future use. So, for subsequent runs you don't have to specify these as system properties.
        The following command is good enough for running the application after it was built, run for the first time and
        the property file was created:</p>
        <pre>
        mvn java:exec
        </pre>
    </body>
